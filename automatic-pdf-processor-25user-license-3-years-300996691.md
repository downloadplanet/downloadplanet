# Automatic PDF Processor - 25-user license (3 years)
With Automatic PDF Processor, PDF files can be processed automatically. Any number of folders can be monitored in order to (among others) automatically print, rename or move incoming PDF files to dynamically named folders. Numerous metadata of the PDF document can be used as well as the content, for example to include invoice information in the file path. The PDF files to be processed can be narrowed down with various profile-specific filters - as filters available are: the document text, PDF metadata and general file information.

Extraction of data from the text of PDF files is optional. An unlimited number of extraction rules can be created within a profile. The extracted data can be used (after optional validation and formatting) for naming folders or the file name, and can be saved as an extract in a CSV file. Another task that can be automated with the Automatic PDF Processor is the extraction of attachments from PDF files, for example to save ZUGFeRD XML files, XRechnung attachments or similar as part of a PDF invoice in the same folder.
