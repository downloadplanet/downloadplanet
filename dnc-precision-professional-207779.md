High precision of machine-controlled operations coupled with extended overall reliability ensure optimum result. Almost everything from photos to financial reports becomes digital.
However, some areas of process automation are somewhat neglected. Despite the fact, numeric control devices are an older technology than digital photography, there are not enough quality software solutions allowing DNC\CNC management. I bet, you can easily name several all-inclusive photo editing tools, while it is really a problem to find good DNC\CNC management software. Will the situation ever change? It has already!
Introducing DNC Precision by AGG Software, the unique feature-packed NC operation and management software, allowing full control of the process via serial port. DNC Precision operates as a multiple NC programming and management gateway allowing for access to numerically controlled device. The application is capable of both manual and automatic commands file transfers, ensuring optimum performance even on those larger systems, which include several machines connected to different serial ports.

Due to highly configurable process control engine it is possible to set DNC Precision up the way which suits best for your DNC needs. Another great feature of DNC Precision is its reporting capability.
