# FTP Password
FTP Password is an universal password recovery tool for FTP accounts. It recovers all FTP logins and passwords stored in your computer by your FTP software. FTP Password supports ALL FTP clients. FTP Password temporarily emulates your FTP server and intercepts all requests addressed to it. When you login to the FTP server, your FTP client has to submit login information (including the password) to the server, so FTP Password can intercept and display the login information.
FTP Password DOES NOT allow to hack somebody's else FTP account. It just extracts password information stored locally in your computer (if any).
