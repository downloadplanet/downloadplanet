# Vanga Rengi Mangaro Registration<br />![Vanga Rengi Mangaro Registration](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300073215/BIG/300073215.GIF)<br />A project to replace Windows's default file open, save and folder selector dialogs, which are exported functions from comdlg32.dll with Filesystem Dialogs's dialogs. Filesystem Dialogs's purpose is to provide the most powerful user-friendly file and folder selection options and simple file managament tools for the session.

Features:
All window/column position/size (sorting) settings are saved for every application and/or you can choose to always use your favourite dialog settings
Very hiqh quality thumbnail mode (that supports much more formats then the Windows dialog, and displays audio files Taged with ID3v2 and containing SESC frame)
Option to cache the thumbnails on a per folder basis (like the Windows dialog's Thumbs.db just with a little bit better quality and with audio file support)
If bass.dll is found audio thumbnails are generated from all formats that BASS supports
FreeImage.dll is supported also (adds many more formats)
Recent document list on a per-application basis (favorite feature) available with one click
Recent folder list, that you can acces very quickly
Customizable favorite folders list
Drag&Drop
Implements by far the best folder selector (with recent and favourite list)
Automatically decodes URL encoded filanames and underscores ("Man%20on_Mars.jpg" -> "Man on Mars.jpg")
Viewer for pictures/images & an integrated web browser for the rest of the files (and a secondary display viewer mode for dual display setups)
Lite version does not replace the Windows dialogs only an icon is added to the tray area to pop-up a file browser dialog.
