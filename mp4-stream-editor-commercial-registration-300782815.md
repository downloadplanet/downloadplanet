Requirements:
3D GraphicsCard with HardwareVertexProcessing and DirectX 9 installed
BASS requires DirectX 3 or above. BASS does not require that a soundcard with DirectSound/DirectSound3D hardware accelerated drivers is installed, but it does improve performance if there is one. BASS also takes advantage of MMX, which improves the performance of the MOD music playback.
The Windows Media Format modules are also required to be installed on the user's system. They are installed with Windows Media player, so will already be on most users' systems, but they can also be installed separately (WMFDIST.EXE).
