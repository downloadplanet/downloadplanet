# Shortcut Manager for Excel<br />Microsoft Office Excel simplifies recurring tasks through the use of macros. The macros themselves can be automatically generated by Excel by using the recording facility (Tools | Macro | Record New Macro...). Macros can also be written in the Visual Basic Editor using VBA.
But the macro code needs to be invoked from one of the menu items in the Excel user interface. There is no way to invoke a macro using keyboard shortcuts. Shortcut Manager for Excel intends to bridge that gap. Using Shortcut Manager, you can assign keyboard shortcuts to existing menu items, recorded macros and macros written in VBE even if they don't appear in the Excel user interface.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300316704&affiliateid=200057808)
