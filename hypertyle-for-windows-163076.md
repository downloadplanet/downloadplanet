HyperTyle is a sophisticated filter plugin for generating texture, surface, paint, erosion, transparency, edge, frame and shadow effects. These main effects are based on seamless textures, so there are unlimited variations possible. Additionally there are also zoom, rotation, metal, chrome, pop-art, warp, mirror, blur, noise, blending and other secondary effects which can be simultaneously applied to the seamless texture which is used for the main effect. So up to 20 different effects can be applied at the same time without leaving the plugin dialog.
The download version of HyperTyle is delivered with 128 seamless photo, synthetic and painting textures. The CD version provides 1000+ seamless textures including 100 high resolution ones. You can also use other textures in BMP format in HyperTyle, e.g. self-created textures, textures downloaded from the web or textures from various image applications like Paint Shop Pro.
The dialog of HyperTyle is skinned and consists of a large preview on the left side and a tab sheet control with all filter parameters on the right side. HyperTyle is fairly easy and intuitive to use. For beginners there's even a Tutorial Mode which displays explanations and tips when the mouse pointer moves over a control. A preset feature lets you save effect settings and reuse them later. 90 useful preset files are already delivered with HyperTyle.
