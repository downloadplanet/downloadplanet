# Small Business Advisor v. 2020 - Single-State Version (downloadable and on CD-ROM) - Download link emailed to you.
Small Business Advisor creates a customized copy of the best-selling business self-help book, 'Starting and Operating a Business in California' (New York, etc.) for any of 32 states or D.C., in a matter of seconds, on your computer -- as HTML hyper-text files, readable with your web browser. This is the 2020 first quarter release, which includes updates for all recent federal tax legislation, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. (The state and 'national' chapters of the various state editions are updated at varying dates during each year. 32 states and D.C. have been updated in 2018, 2019, or 2020.) All federal tax rates and inflation-indexed federal tax items, such as tax brackets, estate and gift exemption amounts, and pension plan limitations for 2020 are now included in this edition. NOTE, however: The following 18 state information segments are no longer being updated since 2013: ID, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, MD, MS, MT, OH, OK, OR, RI, TN, UT, VA, and WI.
Each of the e-books that can be created by this front-end software is assembled from extensive text data files by the software after you go through a brief interview about your business. The software uses your answers to the interview questions to create a fully-customized edition of the book (for your state), tailored specifically for your business. Each of the books the software can create includes up-to-date information on hundreds of small business topics, information and advice on tax and legal requirements for any of the included states and D.C., and a detailed customized business startup checklist for you, based on the facts of your small business, and for your state.
Each book edition consists of 14 chapters and 3 appendices, and is approximately 450 to 500 pages long, if it is printed out from the electronic version that this software creates.
NOTE: You must have the Internet Explorer browser on your computer system in order to view the electronic books that are created by Small Business Advisor. (Access to the Internet is not required to run the program or view the books it creates for you. Nor will you need any kind of specialized e-book reader device.) You may need the free Adobe Reader, but only if you wish to print out some of the included tax forms and worksheets.
