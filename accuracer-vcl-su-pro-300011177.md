Accuracer Database System is the BDE alternative multi-user database system with SQL support providing access to a database in its own single-file format in fast and easy way. It contains 4 components called TACRTable, TACRDatabase, TACRQuery and TACRSession. TACRDatabase is intended for working with several tables in a single file. TACRQuery provides SQL and DDL commands support. TACRSession is specially designed for multithread access. TACRTable is a TTable replacement supporting most of its features such as master/detail, filtering, searching, sorting, Key and Range methods, BLOB fields and some special ones such as data encryption, BLOB data compression, multi-indexes, shareable in memory capabilities, in-memory mode and others. TACRTable doesn't use BDE, has small footprint, provides extremely fast data access with buffering and has the excellent search performance. Accuracer supports storing multiple tables inside the single database file or even inside the executable file. It is fully compatible with standard DB-aware visual controls such as QuickReport, DBGrid, DBNavigator, DBImage, DBMemo, DBRichEdit and others. Accuracer supports calculated and lookup fields. Accuracer provides data importing from and exporting to any data source. It supports internationalization / localization and Unicode. Also there are many useful things such as table restructuring, table data restoring, displaying progress during slow operations with the table data and so on.
