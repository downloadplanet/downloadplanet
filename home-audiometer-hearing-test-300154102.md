The Home Audiometer Hearing Test Windows software turns your PC into a machine you can use to test your hearing through a standard sound card.
While this is clearly not as accurate as a professional audiometer, it can give a good indication if there is a hearing problem or not. (The accuracy is 10-15 dB compared to 5dB accuracy of a professional meter over a total hearing range of 70dB, so worse by a factor of 2-3.)
The unlock key code is valid for all versions of the software, including future updates.
The software is fully compatible with the new audio management in Windows Vista and Windows 7.
