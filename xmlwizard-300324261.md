# XMLWizard<br />XMLwizard is a utility which can be used to load XML, CSV and flat textual files into Firebird databases. CSV is acronym for Comma Separated Values, but various forms of these files are supported (for example, TSV or Tab Separated Values), with user configurable delimiters, qualifiers and record separators. It supports multilevel XML files with unlimited depth of nesting. Beside importing, XMLwizard has a powerful data comparer which can be used to compare the data in input file against the data in the database and show the difference in a grid. In this grid, user can cherry-pick individual rows or even fields to be inserted, updated or deleted from the database.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300324261&affiliateid=200057808)
