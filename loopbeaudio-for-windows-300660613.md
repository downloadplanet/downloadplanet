LoopBeAudio
A Virtual Audio Device - An Audio Loopback Driver
LoopBeAudio is a virtual audio device to transfer audio between computer programs, digitally, without any quality loss.
The technical limits are only restricted through the Operating System. Configure up to 24 audio channels, a sample rate from 8000 Hz to 384000 Hz with a bit depth from 8 bit to 32 bit. Build a virtual 7.1 surround device, even though you don't have the built-in hardware.
LoopBeAudio is a native Windowsâ„¢ WDM kernel mode driver, so expect the lowest possible latency. Programs do not need to link with special libraries, so LoopBeAudio works with every audio-capable Windows application.
Test every Surround Setup with Virtual Speakers
Configure LoopBeAudio with the Windows Sound Control Panel like every other audio device. LoopBeAudio's "Internal Playback" simulates virtual speakers with all possible surround configurations of Windows.
Configure up to 24 channels with Virtual Line devices
LoopBeAudio lets you configure an audio device with more than 8 channels, but Windows will not provide the speaker positions here, therefore LoopBeAudio will behave like a multichannel Line device
Independent Monitoring
While using LoopBeAudio you can forward the audio data to your "real" audio output, without the need for matching formats
A little Status Application in your System Tray.
LoopBeAudio's driver comes with a small system tray application. It keeps LoopBeAudio's playback and record format in sync, displays details like format, monitor and default device and gives you fast access to the Sound Control Panel.
