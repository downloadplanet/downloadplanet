# Windows Password Std<br />Windows Password is an application for Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 system administrators for finding holes in system security. It tries to recover plain-text passwords analyzing user password hashes. If it's possible to recover the password in a reasonable time, the password should be considered to be insecure. Also Windows Password could be used for recovering lost passwords of particular users.Windows Password uses both traditional recovery methods (Brute Force Attack, Dictionary Search) and the new Smart Table Recovery (TM) technique.
