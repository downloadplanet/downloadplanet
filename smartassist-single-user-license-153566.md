SmartAssist
SmartAssist is an advanced windows application that aims to help you to increase your workflow as well as support you avoiding errors.

It does this by 'watching you work' and reacting whenever you ask for it's help simply by typing a certain string.

Whenever you type a so called trigger string SmartAssist reacts accordingly by either
showing a tooltip
replacing what you typed with a user defined text
pop up a powerful fully customizable html dialog to build complex texts to be typed.
or executing a user specified application.
It does not matter what application you are working with when typing the string! SmartAssist works with almost every windows application.
