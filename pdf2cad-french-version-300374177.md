Just select the PDF file you want to transform, specify your conversion options and convert the file into widely-supported CAD file formats, DXF and HPGL. pdf2cad is accurate, fast and robust. It will quickly become an indispensable tool for unlocking and editing the objects and text in the PDF files you receive or archive.

Whether you work in Architecture, Engineering, Construction or Manufacturing, you're probably storing and exchanging designs, schematics, floor-plans and other technical drawings in the Adobe PDF file format. CAD engineers, CNC operators, partners and supply chain members need to be able to view, test, edit or reuse these documents. pdf2cad provides the bridge. It accurately reproduces lines, shapes, text and scale of the original drawing in the DXF and HPGL formats.

The key to a successful conversion is to know what type of PDF file you have. There are two types  vector PDF and raster PDF. If the PDF file was generated by another application, it is most likely a vector PDF file. This is the ideal input format for pdf2cad which will return scalable, editable vector objects and text with the highest degree of accuracy. If the PDF file is a scanned drawing, it is a raster PDF and pdf2cad is limited to raster-to-raster conversion. This will produce a reliable tracing layer for your CAD system but it will not be editable at the object layer. The only options for converting scanned drawings into editable objects include either electronic tracing with a raster-to-vector software program or through manual redrawing. For raster PDF files, pdf2cad will create a tracing layer to help with redrawing.

Visual Integrity's pdf2cad is also available in batch, server and developer versions, and on Linux and UNIX platforms. Other available output formats include CGM, WMF, EMF, PDF, PostScript, EPS, SVG, MIF, TIFF, GIF, JPEG, PNG, BMP, ASCII.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300374177&affiliateid=200057808)
