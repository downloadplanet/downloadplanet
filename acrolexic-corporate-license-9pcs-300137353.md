AcroLexic allows you to find acronyms' meaning fast and effectively.

Quick search option allows you to find the definition of the selected acronym. You can select the acronym in any other software and press the hot key, which can be adjusted at the Settings window and the acronym's definitions will be instantly shown in the definition window.
Export and Import functions allow you to save your custom acronyms and their definitions into the file with .acro extension. This is very helpful feature, if you have the large list of custom acronyms and do not want to lose them.Or if want to share your custom acronyms with someone.
