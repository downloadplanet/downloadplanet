tlCorpus Corpus Query Software (Concordance Software) helps you to readily and rapidly study actual language usage. tlCorpus allows you to compile a database of texts in one or more languages, and then allows you to conduct searches on the texts or compile statistics or generate wordlists. An integrated Web crawler also allows automated retrieval of web pages to be added to the corpus. tlCorpus supports many different file formats, including HTML, PDF, MOBI, EPUB, FB2 (FictionBook), RTF, Microsoft Word (.doc), CHM and more. Runs on Windows and Mac OS X. Please note this software is available as electronic download (i.e. we do not ship physical CD-ROMs).
