# SFV Checker
SFV Checker uses CRC-32 technology to check each file and notifies you of any potentially bad, corrupt, incorrect size or missing files to save you hours of downloading only to find you have 1 file missing or the last file has a CRC checksum error. The CRC value comparison is done by using a standard SFV file. If an SFV file is not available, you can drag and drop the file into the list view to produce the calculated CRC value. An informative report log is generated after file scanning that provides a list of missing and inconsistent files, as well as, a summary for the archive. SFV Checker can also concatenate files in the list and rename multi archives on the fly, e.g. Correct file naming for .001, .002, .003 files into .rar, .r00, r01 files. SFV Checker supports RAR, ARJ, ACE and ALL other Binary/Text file types.
All Updates to 1.xx are free of charge.
