OutlookSpy is the ultimate Outlook developer tool; integrated directly into Outlook, it provides fast and convenient access to virtually all Outlook Object Model objects, lets you examine values of the properties, call functions, browse object hierarchy and monitor Outlook events. CDO is supported too!
If you are a die-hard Extended MAPI developer or just curious about what really goes on under the hood, OutlookSpy will provide you with an access to the Extended MAPI interfaces that Outlook uses internally. See how Outlook data is stored, browse MAPI hierarchy, watch Extended MAPI notifications, etc.
Forget about VB Object Browser or MFCMAPI, see what you've been missing!
