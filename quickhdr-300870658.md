Quick HDR is very fast and highly enjoyable image enhancement software and a batch processor to apply many popular Film processing and HDR effects to the modern digital camera images in 128 bit color depth precision.
Unlike a HDR software such as Dynamic Photo HDR where you need multiple image exposures, QuickHDR is build from ground-up with the purpose of applying the same effect to a single image source.

No need to take multiple exposures, just use any of the pictures you already have
Accurate Preview unlike full HDR
It is much faster than any full HDR, changing values immediately produces visible results
We process each pixel in 128bit color depth (unlike the standard 24 bit) to be sure we don't introduce any unnecessary clipping
