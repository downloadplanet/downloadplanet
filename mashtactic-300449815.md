# MashTactic<br />MashTactic can separate different parts of a full mix, manipulating different frequencies and stereo location. Up to eight zones can be created that can then be panned, emphasised or cut out completely. It can be viewed as an eight band filter that exists in stereo ranges as well as frequency. Transients of varying length can be separated from constant sounds, which allows the user to manipulate the initial punch of percussion, either by emphasising or softening the attack, this can be done separately in any of the eight zones.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300449815&affiliateid=200057808)
