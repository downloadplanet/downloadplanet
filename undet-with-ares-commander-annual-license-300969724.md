Combining the powerful Undet project database with Ares Commander we created a cost-effective solution to work with point clouds in a familiar CAD User Interface.

Intuitive CAD interface and native DWG support
The user interface is built on Qt technology (the same used in AutoCAD), complete with ribbon, dockable toolbars and palettes, menu bar, right-click menus, aliases, and shortcut keystrokes.
Well familiar CAD tools and commands
Create detailed 2D ground plans, sections and facade elevations using common CAD tools and a familiar workflow.
