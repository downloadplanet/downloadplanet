# PDF Printer for Windows 11 Personal License
To an application, the PDF Printer looks like a printer and allows the application to write a document as a PDF Document in the same way it would print the document to the printer. When a user prints their document to PDF Printer, rather than sending the file to a laser jet or inkjet printer, the software creates a PDF Document.
