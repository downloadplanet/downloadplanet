SimpleSYN Standard is the synchronization solution for synchronizing Outlook on several computers effectively and competitively. The data synchronization is carried out via local network (LAN, WLAN) – automatically and in real-time. No cloud-service or Exchange server necessary!
Whether you wish to synchronize e-mails, calendar, contacts, notes or tasks, SimpleSYN will keep your data up-to-date and uniform, regardless of where you are. Only a few simple steps and the practical Sync-software is installed, ready to use, and running unobtrusively in the background.
After the initial synchronization the program initiates the data exchange automatically as soon as an Outlook element is changed on a computer. The clear and intuitive user interface allows new users to easily navigate through the program.
SimpleSYN is completely flexible in its setup. Direction and type of synchronization (new, altered and deleted elements) can be individually configured for every Outlook folder. This way you can synchronize changes to the Outlook database in one direction only or just synchronize new and altered e-mails. You would like to synchronize different Outlook folders on several computers? SimpleSYN can deliver! You can configure SimpleSYN individually on multiple computers so that your colleague receives the newest appointments and tasks, but not the e-mails irrelevant to his work.
SimpleSYN is the ideal software for work teams and companies who must frequently exchange Outlook data. With SimpleSYN you can use Outlook together as a team, e.g., to run a common calendar to keep their schedule current, or to provide a central databank for contacts. SimpleSYN also offers the ideal platform for sales representatives or individuals for a fast Outlook synchronization between various computers.
