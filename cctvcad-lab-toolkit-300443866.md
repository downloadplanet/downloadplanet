# CCTVCAD Lab Toolkit<br />Using CCTVCAD Lab Toolkit you can: Measure sensitivity and resolution of real video cameras, optical transmission and resolution of lenses and filters, infrared light power in order to obtain precise parameters for modeling (illumination meter is additionally required). Measure exposure time and threshold illumination of IP cameras. Measure rolling shutter row time of IP cameras with CMOS sensor (oscilloscope and low-frequency oscillator are additionally required). Analyze real video images and live video on the computer monitor. Measure frame rate, signal-to-noise ratio and other parameters. Analyze separate lines of image, measure object/background contrast. Determine from the Spectral Power Distribution curves and measure in practice the Spectral efficiency of visible and infrared light sources for the different image sensors. Independent measuring parameters of CCTV equipment is necessary for proper designing and modeling in VideoCAD because commonly manufacturer's specifications have not enough parameters or parameter's values are uncertain.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300443866&affiliateid=200057808)
