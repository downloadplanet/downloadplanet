SFS use cases:
File of custom format. Typically if the application uses different data like texts, images, binary data, there should be a plenty of files for each type of data. With SFS you get a unique ability to store all these files as a parts of a single file with minimum changes in your application code. Additionally SFS gives you advanced compression and encryption capabilities, so you can easily decrease the size of application data and protect it from unauthorized access.
Archiver. SFS provides the user a simple possibility to create, manage, protect and control archive files in user application.
Backup software. With SFS the user gets an easy way to perform secure, hard compressed or fast backups in user application.
Multimedia application. SFS help you essentially decrease the hard disk space and increase convenience of work with huge number of small files such as sound or graphic files collection as well as make your application compatible with all OS if it uses huge files (> 2GB) such as video files.
