# ModbusConstructor<br />MobdusConstructor was created to help developers, programmers and users in testing and setting up their MODBUS devices.
MobdusConstructor allows to quickly create a data management model for any of your MODBUS devices. There are similar programs on the market all of which, however, display data as columns of abstract numbers of the same type. This makes them hard to read and analyze, especially if your device uses randomly arranged data of various types.
In MobdusConstructor you can work with any of the key data types: integer, long (integer), float, double (float), or byte for any individual register or a set of registers. Integer types may be represented as signed, unsigned, HEX or binary. The same register can be represented in various ways. For example, if there are two adjacent registers that contain long numbers, each of these registers can be given additional data fields in which their content will be represented as HEX or unsigned integer.
Data fields corresponding to your data elements (registers or discreet elements) can be arranged to your liking inside the project form window. You can specify size, color, font and caption for each field. The discreet elements occupying a continuous addresses domain can share the same field, which makes them easier to read and saves time.
In MobdusConstructor you can setup any register data field to perform a linear transformation to convert the internal units into conventional or alternative units of any system. For example, if a register contains pressure in milliamperes, i.e. the device receives data from a pressure detector equipped with a current output, the resulting value can be converted to kgf/cm2 or lb/in2.
MobdusConstructor supports automatic requests for all supported functions (01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 15, 16, 22, 23) with individual periods for each one.
You can setup requests to be executed via menus and/or dialogs, whichever preferred. This is a convenient way of setting up control commands, changing parameters and test requests. Any project may be used for querying a device in Master mode or simulating it in Slave mode. For the Slave mode you may additionally include a data modification procedure operating according to this or that rule.
In MobdusConstructor your project can be further enhanced with additional captions, frames and images.
MobdusConstructor comes with a special utility, ModbusReader, which operates using the model created with MobdusConstructor to interact with your device. ModbusReader is a freeware program. If you have already created a MobdusConstructor project for the device you designed, your clients will not have to purchase MobdusConstructor â€“ it is enough to download a freeware ModbusReader.
ModbusReader can run several projects at once, i.e. query or simulate several devices using one or more COM-ports. In addition to the requests specified in your project, you can modify any of your device's data elements by simply clicking on any associated data field, whether in Master (by sending an appropriate request) or Slave mode.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300115413&affiliateid=200057808)
