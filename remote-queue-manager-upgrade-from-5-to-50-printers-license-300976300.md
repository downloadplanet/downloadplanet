# Remote Queue Manager (Upgrade from 5 to 50 Printers license)<br />Every time you use the "Print" function in one of your applications, the information goes to a spool on your hard disk before being sent to the printer. If you are printing several documents, they form a print queue. Even if you have only one printer directly connected to your computer, it's easy to get into a mess. Print jobs have a lot of complicated parameters. Simply by selecting a wrong page size/orientation, a wrong color or a page collating mode, you can end up with tons of wasted paper, ink, time and nerves. Worst of all is that the documents themselves have a tendency to contain typos. Required corrections always come to your attention only after sending a document to the printer.

In offices where several people share the same printer across a network, this problem appears often and a good reliable tool to manage the printer queue is a must. Unfortunately, standard methods of printer queue management offered in Windows are rather limited. You have to distinguish jobs by their not very descriptive names and usually "Cancel" is the only action available. In addition, to control a remote printer's queue, you need to install its drivers on your local PC.

Remote Queue Manager is a professional tool to manage printer jobs. There is no need to install any drivers to control a remote printer. The program uses the remote computer's drivers. Instead of searching through non-descriptive job names, Remote Queue Manager allows you to visually preview documents in the spool. You can easily connect to a remote printer cancelling unwanted jobs or changing the priority for others. The program also allows you to view properties for every printer job (paper size and orientation, printing preferences etc).

Do you have more than one printer in your network? If so, that's NOT a problem. Remote Queue Manager helps you control all the printers in your organization, right from where you sit.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300976300&affiliateid=200057808)
