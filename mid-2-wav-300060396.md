# MID 2 WAV
Convert MID files into WAV files with one click! MIDI files only contain information about the notes to play. This means mid files will play different on every sound card and you can not burn mid files on a music CD or copy it to your mp3 player. This program records the midi output of your sound card and saves the result as wav file. If you compose your own music with a midi sequencer you will be able to burn your music on a music cd or import it to your wave editor to mix it with other samples.
