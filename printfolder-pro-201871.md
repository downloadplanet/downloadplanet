In fact, it's almost impossible. PrintFolder Pro is a fast and efficient utility that lets you print a list of files in any folder (and in its subfolders, too, if you wish). Beyond being extremely easy to use, you can customize file lists to fit your own preferences. List filenames only, or include file size, date, time, attributes, and more.
PrintFolder Pro is distributed as shareware. If you wish to use the program beyond the 30-day trial period, you must register. Registration benefits includes free upgrades and support.
