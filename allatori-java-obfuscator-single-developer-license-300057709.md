# Allatori Java Obfuscator - Single Developer License
Allatori is a second generation Java obfuscator, which offers a full spectrum of protection for your intellectual property.

Although most second generation obfuscators allow for a worthy level of protection, we have developed a number of additional functions into Allatori to make reverse engineering the code nigh on impossible.

Allatori does not just obfuscate, it also minimizes application size, and boosts the speed, and all the while your code is unreadable by anyone but you and your team. Allatori, as every modern Java obfuscator, has full watermark functionality, allowing potential for proper licensing of your software!

If it is necessary for you to protect your software, and if you want to reduce both its size and processing time, Allatori obfuscator is for you.
