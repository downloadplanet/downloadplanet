Heroglyph Version 2 : easier - more effects - far-reaching - kindlier !
Version 1 already got good reviews : the tenor: "Heroglyph - a good program with good capabilities for perfect quality videotitels and trailerproductions".

Only the handling was considered critical some times...
also some users came to this conclusion and some of them still could not use the whole great potential of this software.

But that`s the past... and we could learn from many replies and wishes:
sample SUCCESSFUL-IN-ONLY-2-MINUTES (creating a animated route)!

Therefore the new version is different, it is application-oriented : extreme easy to use, it assists during title and effect design and again it includes complete new effect and use possibilities.

Now - really all cutters can use the fantastic potential of this software with the new look & feel and everybody will produce excellent high quality titels and stunning trailers with Heroglyph V2!
Easier...
New key-feature: Route-designer! Create visualisations of your trips/tours on imported maps. Show matching pictures or sequences or titles during the time the route appears. Just perfect for animated visualisations of travel-routes, for charts or racetracks etc.
