# Flash-Creator
Flash Creator is a quick and refreshingly easy-to-use tool for creating animated Flash logos, banners, intros, headers and anything else that you can imagine right out of the box. It provides you with a point-and-click design environment that allows anyone, regardless of creative ability and knowledge of Flash technologies, blend texts, vector objects and images into an engaging Flash animation that can give a professional look to your website. Flash Creator's animations have an extremely small file size, only 10-20 Kb, and don't take long to load on a web page. Flash Creator lets you add an object, set a motion path you want an object to follow and then specify its starting state and end state. In doing this, you can configure such object properties as size, color, transparency, and rotation. At any moment, you can preview your animation in a web browser to see how your changes affect the animation. When the desired result is achieved, you must customize properties for the entire animation, including its width, height, frame rate, and background color and then click on the Generate Flash File button. For your convenience, Flash Creator can generate a single SWF file and an HTML code for your page. Flash animations are the most popular eye-candy makers and integrating them to a web site can make it more professional and appealing to your web visitors. With Flash Creator's animations you can capture customers' attention and deliver your message much more effectively than with text-heavy pages. Flash Creator is perfect for website owners and software developers who need a Flash animation, but don't have time to learn complicated Macromedia Flash or don't want to spend money on Flash designers, endless training courses or expensive Flash tools
