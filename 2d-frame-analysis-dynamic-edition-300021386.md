# 2D Frame Analysis - Dynamic Edition<br />2D Frame Analysis is a powerful application that can perform a wide range of calculations on 2D structures (beams, trusses, frames etc.). The structure can be drawn directly using the versatile featured user interface. The user can also import standard steel sections from a complete shape library according to all major codes (AISC, Australian-New Zealand, BS, Chinese, European, Indian, Aluminum etc.) There are no limitations regarding the geometry of the structure, materials or loads, since the program can handle any arbitrary 2D structure under static, dynamic, linear and non-linear loads. Among its capabilities, 2D Frame Analysis can calculate and graphically illustrate deformations, internal forces, dynamic modes and other analysis results. A large material library is also available according to almost all concrete, steel, timber, aluminum etc. material specifications. Apart from these, the user can define custom material and cross section data for use in the structure that is modelled.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300021386&affiliateid=200057808)
