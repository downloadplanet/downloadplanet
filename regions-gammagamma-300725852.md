# REGIONS Gamma-Gamma<br />![REGIONS Gamma-Gamma](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300725852/BIG/300725852.JPG)<br />REGIONS Gamma-Gamma (REGIONS Y) – is software for modeling gamma-quanta distribution in continua. The program is based on the Monte-Carlo simulation of the gamma interaction with the physical objects. The interactions taken into account are the Compton scattering, photoelectric absorption and pair production. The REGIONS Y program has unique, totally analytical parametric geometry modeler. All geometry can be created as a set of analytical parametric equations. This feature allows modeling geometry objects with zero error precision. The geometry parameters can be changed easily at any moment of problem solution. Changing geometry allows researchers investigate the solution behavior depending on the geometric parameters (example – detector spectrum depending on the distance from gamma source).<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300725852&affiliateid=200057808)
