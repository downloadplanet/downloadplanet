# PDF Page Color Split 2
PDF Page Color Split is an Acrobat plug-in tool for full commercial version of Acrobat which is used to split pdf pages on Page Color, so for example you could have a PDF with 10 pages - some color and some black and white gray scale but you don't know where they are and you want to output them to separate files?, then this tool will do it all for you in one click! Various output options include outputting to two files - one for color and one for gray scale, or to folder COLOR or GRAY for each type of page, each page can be output separately for post processing and the tool also has a re-merge feature for merging the pages back together after you have processed them all. so for example you wanted to process the pages with color into BW then you could split out to individual pages and process them in another tool and re-merge with this tool. All updates to v1.xx are free.
