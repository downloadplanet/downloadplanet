# CyberMatrix In Out Scheduler
CyberMatrix In Out Scheduler is a group attendance management program that provides office workers with a simple convenient way of showing which employees are not present and when they will return. In Out Scheduler was designed to provide an effortless transition for those accustomed to the traditional in/out peg boards. To this end, the software looks much like an actual scheduling peg board. Virtual pins are used to show which employees are in, which are out and when they will come back. Unlike the manual scheduling boards though, In Out Scheduler can be used by all employees from the comfort of their own computers.
In Out Scheduler Web can be used to access the in/out schedule remotely using virtually any browser on any machine anywhere in the world.
