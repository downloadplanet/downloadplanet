Our eyes are very adaptive and they are also more sensitive to intensity than color. It is estimated that our eye can see over a dynamic range of nearly 24 f-stops while a digital camera can capture a dynamic range around 6 to 9 f-stops.

The High Dynamic Range Imaging is a set of techniques that has been developed nearly 20 years ago to overcome the limitations of electronic devices.
Using HDR technique we can combine the different exposures to create a single image that shows details in both sky and the land.
A HDR photography can be created by taking few photos with different exposure, then combining them in the software into a high dynamic file. The last thing is to tone-map the HDR image so we can see it in our screen, print it, post on web and enjoy.

We created our software to be enjoyable, fast and straight forward. And as it is common for Mediachance products we added many cool new things that you may not have seen yet in a package of this price.
