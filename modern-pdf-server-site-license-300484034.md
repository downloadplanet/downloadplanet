# Modern PDF Server Site License<br />Unlike many similar server-based software, Modern PDF Server intercepts documents extremely fast on their way to the printer, creating a version in Adobe's PDF format instead of spitting out a physical piece of paper.
The software installs as a virtual print driver, which means users need only click the print button in any application to create a PDF file. Users can choose the page size and orientation, resolution, and whether a font should be embedded or not. It allows documents to be encrypted, and user permissions to be set. A specific image can be set as a page background to watermark a document. The conversion speed and quality is incredibly high, and generated PDF file is arguably the smallest in the world. With the caveat that there are similar products widely available that offer much the same functionality, we recommend Modern PDF Server software product to you as a high-quality, high-performance, server-based, one-stop solution for deploying PDF creation ability across your organization!
