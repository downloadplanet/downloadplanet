Quite a number of programs use the QuickReport format to export lists, reports and graphics. These reports may be saved as files (*.qrp). But to view the report one need the original program.
The "QuickReport Viewer" views and prints those QuickReport Files.
The Original Program is'nt neccesary. So one can send reports as qrp-files via E-Mail. With the help of the "QuickReport Viewer" the recipient is able to show and print them.
