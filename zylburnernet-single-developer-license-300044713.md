# ZylBurner.NET - Single Developer License
ZylBurner.NET is a CD / DVD burner .NET component. It is based on NeroCmd utility, so it needs Nero Burning ROM to be installed. This component is very easy to use, it's ideal for developers for quick CD / DVD writing purposes from .NET applications. The component works in two modes: synchronous mode and asynchronous mode. In synchronous mode the operational functions (Burn, Erase, BurnImage, Eject) always wait for the end of the current operation and return a value which indicates if the operation was successful or not. In synchronous mode the return value of the operational functions is always 0, and the functions don't wait for the end of the current operation. You can use it to burn data CDs / DVDs, audio CDs, video CDs and supervideo CDs. ZylBurner.NET is written 100% in C# using .Net framework.
