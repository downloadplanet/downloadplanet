It will then correct these variations by automatically increasing or decreasing the levels of attenuation at specific frequency intervals (usually 1/3 octave). The result is a nearly linear frequency response. For the listener, this creates more consistent sounding audio. A typical application that would benefit from this tool is an internet radio station. A common problem that many of these stations experience is an inconsistency in true audio reproduction (i.e., different songs sound different).<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300669438&affiliateid=200057808)
