# Code-VB6<br />With Code-VB coding tools added to your Visual Basic development environment (VBE) you create better Visual Basic code faster. A set of 17 specialized code builders supports the fast creation of most used code. Using the builders reduces the amount of typing, makes the code more consistent and complete and reduces errors. Code-VB features: Code Library: - Finding and using (built-in and custom) procedures - Code fragments library Code Generators - Creating procedures - Fast declaration of variables and constants - Working with enumerated types - Flexible error handling - Object Oriented Programming Working with classes, collections and properties - Includes code explorer. The ability to customize the builders is very important if one wants to support different developers each with their own preferences (e.g. how to do error handling). 40 different settings logically organized let you make each builder work exactly the way you want it. Additionally the fragments (headers, error handlers, etc.) used by the builders can be tailored to your needs. With easy to memorize access keys there is no need for using the mouse.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300021216&affiliateid=200057808)
