# Papier Formulier Ontwerper<br />Create your own paper forms for printing. Do not care about the layout at all. Simply enter all you want to query: name, street, city etc. Possible fields are text fields or free size, checkbox fields and radio fields. You can sort the fields into different segments (categories). Write an introduction text for each of the segments or add an image for the segments. You can also include your company logo in the headline and a free text in the headline and footer of the page. Now the program will generate your paper form with one mouse click.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300421902&affiliateid=200057808)
