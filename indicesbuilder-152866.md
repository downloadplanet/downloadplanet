# IndicesBuilder<br />![IndicesBuilder](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P152866/BIG/152866.JPG)<br />IndicesBuilder allows you to design custom indices using your MetaStock files. The index reflects the average open, high, low, close and volume and allows you to view a chart of it and run tests on it in MetaStock. So it is very easy for you to partition the stock market into sub groups and track each group movement via the analysis of each groupâ€™s custom made index. There is no limit on the number of stocks that can be added to the index. Furthermore, you can also add stocks to the index that are located in different directories. It is possible to store the price records of the index in MetaStock format and/or in form of Ascii files.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=152866&affiliateid=200057808)
