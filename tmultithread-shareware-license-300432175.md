TMultiThread is a Delphi component for use in Win32, Win64 (XP/Vista/7/8/10), OSX, iOS, Android and Linux software. It's a non-visual class that helps creating a thread pool, for example for creating a multi threaded thumbnailer or any other task that needs many threads. Use automatic mode or specify a max. thread count and simply add work to the class and the jobs are automatically distributed among the available threads, and when the work is ready a callback event is called with the result. TMultiThread is optimized to be used for many threads of the same type but can be used for various work too. It has a built-in message system to report progress etc., events for thread start, thread stop, option to automatically free the objects and no Synchronize() is used at all, so it is also safe to use the component in a .dll.
