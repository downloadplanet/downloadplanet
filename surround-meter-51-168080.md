The installation of the PAS Surround Meter for the use of discrete 5.1-mixtures is very easy as the six channels played by either the mixer sum or the HD-recording system will be connected directly with the inputs of the audio card installed on the computer for the PAS-software. During the installation process, the user can decide about the display order of the surround channels. In the help files, the basic setup of the surround meter and all internal settings are described in detail. While the usual digital level indicators only show a scaling without norm status, five of the most established standardised scaling known from the analogue application can be used with the PAS Surround Meter. The commonly applied DIN45406 with a head room of 6 dB referred to digital 0, Nordic N9, BBC PPM and EBU PPM K-System K-20 K-14 K-12 are easily and individually recallable by using the Windows-function keys F1 to F 8
