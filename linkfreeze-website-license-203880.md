Losing too many search engine visitors because of the dynamic links? Convert them into static ones automatically with LinkFreeze. Many webmasters are dependent on dynamic links in order for their sites to be efficient. Dynamic links are ubiquitously used for forums, e-catalogs, news and other frequently updated web site sections. However, search engines either completely ignore these pages or grant them low page rank, which results in little or no search engine visibility. Luckily, with LinkFreeze, any webmaster can continue using dynamic links without any repercussions from the search engines. LinkFreeze modifies links before a server sends a response to the client and rewrites URLs back when they go to the server. Link optimization is done very easily and transparently to the webmaster (simple GUI, no scripting or text configuration) and may be applied to an existing web site or only to parts of it.
