# ProDrenalin V1
GoPro cameras are fantastic for capturing life’s most amazing adventures though sometimes with some adjustments they can be even better. ProDrenalin is a ridiculously simple & affordable tool for automatically removing fisheye & perspective distortion, stabilizing, correcting rolling-shutter, and even de-noising the video. Want more?
