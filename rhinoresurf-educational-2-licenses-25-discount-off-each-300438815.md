RhinoResurf for Rhino is a reverse engineering plug-in for RhinocerosÂ® 3.0 and 4.0. This plug-in gives Rhino the ability to reconstruct the geometry of an object from a mesh or point cloud which describes it.
  RhinoResurf for Rhino can drape a surface over a point cloud with specified tolerance. Draping a surface is similar to laying a piece of cloth over an object. The surface is deformed to take the shape of the object along the drape direction. The drape direction is calculated automatically. Command: RsPoints2Surf
  RhinoResurf for Rhino can convert an open mesh model to a single NURB surface with specified tolerance. The mesh is allowed to have interior holes in the model. Command: RsMesh2Surf
  RhinoResurf for Rhino can convert sub-mesh in an open mesh to a single NURB surface with specified tolerance. User selects a mesh, and defines a sub-mesh by drawing closed lines on the selected mesh. Then just click right-mouse button, the sub-mesh will be converted to a NURB surface. Command: RsMesh2Surf
  RhinoResurf for Rhino can convert an open or closed mesh to multiple NURB surfaces. User selects a mesh, and defines a curve network by drawing lines on the selected mesh. Then just click one or two buttons, the selected mesh will be converted to multiple NURB surfaces with specified tolerance. The transition between any two NURBS surface patches reaches G1 continuity. Command: RsMesh2Surfs
  RhinoResurf for Rhino can merge several meshes into one mesh body. Command: RsMergeMeshs
  RhinoResurf for Rhino is designed to be extremely user friendly and easy to understand. You load it manually at the first time and it automatically loads itself into the Rhino environment later. Once loaded it adds new commands to Rhino's existing commands and a new submenu called "Resurf" to the Rhino menu containing these newly added commands.
