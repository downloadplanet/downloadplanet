# TRegistration Commercial License<br />![TRegistration Commercial License](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300091297/BIG/300091297.PNG)<br />A Delphi component for use in Win32 (9x/ME/2K/XP) software.
Main aim is simplicity, it's not for a hardcore program protection. On the contrary, it's for convinience.
You put it on the form and have a component that handles the registered/unregistered state of you application and includes a form for the user.
You can select (and specify exactly) where do you want to keep your settings an .ini file or the registry, has a couple of events also (you can replace the registration number calculating algorithm in no time with an event) and properties too.

The other part of the component is the Registration Tool, with which you can handle and manage the registration database.
The system is designed for manual use:
Registering a user takes maximum around a minute work
Multiple projects can be managed
You can handle max. 1 million registered users (999999 registrants maximum)
