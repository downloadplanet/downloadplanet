# Print Censor Personal (Single Printer license)<br />Each time your employee prints a document, it costs your business anywhere between 1 and 5 cents, depending on paper format, type of printer, number and "amount" of colors used and so on. Color "photographic quality" copies can cost several times more. Even if you are running a midsize operation (50 people or less) and each employee prints only a few copies of personal correspondence or any other document not directly related to business each month, the total cost over a year amounts to hundreds, even thousands dollars. Can your business afford this? You can now eliminate unnecessary expenses by installing Print Censor and setting individual printing quotas. Naturally, a secretary or an accountant may need a higher limit than other employees - that's why Print Censor is set to be very flexible. The quota can also be easily increased when workload increases. Luckily, most employees are responsible and mature individuals who understand proper work ethics, eliminating the need to control them. But Print Censor can come in handy here as well. The software gathers valuable statistics about each print job: user name, computer name, document name, date and time, number of pages, number of copies, volume in bytes, priority status, paper size, color, whether it is duplex or not. After detailed analysis, you can decide how you can bring total expenses down by simply showing each employee his or her printing activity report. Print Censor is very simple and beginner-friendly. The program uses step-by-step setup, which means that any user can easily install and run the program. Print Censor is distributed electronically over the Internet and is free to try!
