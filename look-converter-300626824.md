Working with LUTs (Lookup Tables) is gaining popularity. Photoshop has introduced the LUT adjustment layer in version CS6. Newer versions of Premiere and After Effects can also apply LUTs to videos. Final Cut Pro X as well as older versions of Premiere, After Effects, Final Cut and Motion allow you to apply LUTs through plug-ins.
At the same time there are numerous filter apps like DxO Filmpack. Instagram, Oggl and many more as well as various filter presets for Lightroom and others.
Unfortunately, most software applications use their own formats. But it is possible to save the basic colorization or look into a universal format (the LUT) like for example .3dl .cube or .mga.
