# Fusion Field<br />![Fusion Field](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300260631/BIG/300260631.JPG)<br />Fusion Field is a smooth reverb that sits beautifully in a mix. It's clean, unobtrusive sound has a natural falloff that floats behind, and complements the source material perfectly. Fusion Field is very easy to use, and the main display shows the effects of the dampening and EQ in a plain natural way. The reverberation can be dampened in the upper and lower frequencies, allowing soft sibilance and a graceful, lifting air to the sound. Having very few controls does not hinder Fusion Field's usefulness. The dial ranges have been sloped to give the best sensitivity in useful regions, and the whole unit can create short snappy rooms, or vast time-suspended spaces, and anything in between.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300260631&affiliateid=200057808)
