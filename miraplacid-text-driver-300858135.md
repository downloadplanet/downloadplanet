# Miraplacid Text Driver<br />Miraplacid Text Driver extracts text from any printable documents. After installation on your PC, Miraplacid Text Driver appears as a new printer in your system. When document is printed, Miraplacid Text Driver opens a dialog with Preview Window. You can save resulting text to disk, upload to FTP or HTTP server, email it, print it to a real printer, or send to Clipboard. You can save the extracted information as plain, formatted text or as XML or RSS feed for future processing in all installed codepages and Unicode. Miraplacid Text Driver adds an icon to the desktop. All the documents you drag and drop to this icon will be printed behind the scenes and processed by Miraplacid Text Driver. Turn 'Auto Save Mode' on to handle text extraction and processing without waiting for your input. If you want every document to be saved to an individual file, add {{DATE}}, {{TIME}}, {{SYSFOLDER}}, {{IDENTITY}}, {{PAGE}} or {{JOB}} to the file name or path. They will be replaced with current date, time, some unique number, page number and print job id respectively. With 'Print a copy to' option, you can print original print job to your physical printer at the time of extracting text. You can choose between Unix(LF) and Windows(CRLF) line breaks. You can create multiple virtual text drivers in your system, each with individual settings. If you need to save one form to disk and send the other form by email, just print one form to one virtual printer and the other - to the second virtual printer. Miraplacid Text Driver supports text printing from DOS programs. As a developer, you may control printing process from your own software.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300858135&affiliateid=200057808)
