# DOSPRN<br />![DOSPRN](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300914245/BIG/300914245.PNG)<br />This program helps to extend life to old DOS programs. Nowadays, many laser and jet printers have powerful features but ... can not print a simple text accurately. Besides, some inexpensive printers can not print in text mode at all (the so-called win-printers or GDI-devices).

DOSPRN allows you to use a good old DOS program with new printers irrespective of their types (Yes, USB and network printers, print-servers, and PDF-printers too!)

Also DOSPRN supports Epson and HP PCL Esc-sequences emulation, multiple international codepages, landscape/portrait printing, text color manipulation, absolute positioning and many other features.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300914245&affiliateid=200057808)
