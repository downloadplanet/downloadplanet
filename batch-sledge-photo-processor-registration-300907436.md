# Batch Sledge Photo Processor Registration<br />![Batch Sledge Photo Processor Registration](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300907436/BIG/300907436.PNG)<br />Batch Sledge Photo Processor is a powerful batch image processing application with an innovative user configurable process path functionality. The application implements tasks and the user can construct a custom process from these tasks. There are 3 different task objects: a simple 'task' item, that receives an input, performs processing, and returns an output, a 'case' item that receives an input and decides at which output to forward the input object and continue the process, and a 'result' (save picture) item. All these items' pins can be connected visually in the editor with the mouse. The application also supports saving and loading of the process configuration with a preset system.
