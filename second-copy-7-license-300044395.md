# Second Copy 7 - License<br />Second Copy 7 copies files and folders from one location to another on the same drive another drive or across the network. You can setup "profiles" that describe the source location the destination location and the frequency at which you want to copy the files. Second Copy monitors the source files for changes and additions and then automatically copies the new or changed files to their designated destination. The program uses familiar Windows 95 Explorer interface. An easy to use setup profile Wizard makes the configuration job a snap. Advanced options include PKZIP compatible compression, AES encryption, password protection, directory synchronization and background thread priority control. You can also include or exclude specific file or sets of files from the copy. Once you configure the profiles with your important file locations the program sits as an icon in Windows system tray and unobtrusively copies files in the background. Ideal for those of us who forget to do periodic backups. Can be used to synchronize files between the desktop and laptop or between two remote sites. Also useful for distributing software to several PCs on the network. The setup program includes a fully functional shareware software. visit our web site at http://www.secondcopy.com.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.element5.com/esales/product.html?productid=300044395&affiliateid=200057808)
