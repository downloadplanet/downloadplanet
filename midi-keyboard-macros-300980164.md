A new Approach to Windows Macros You can now use your MIDI pads, keyboards or controllers to create short-keys and macros for graphics apps, video editing, 3D software, text editors … yes even music apps in a way that it wasn’t possible before. MIDI Keyboard Macros can also work with MIDI rotation and slider controls using its powerful Scripting Language. You can for example use just a single MIDI slider to cycle between tools in Photoshop or create a multiple text clipboard and select which clipboard to use with a knob. Pads and keys can also transmit velocity so you may create macro where pressing a pad will trigger one action (for example moving to next word in text processor) but hitting it harder will trigger a different action (for example selecting the next word)
