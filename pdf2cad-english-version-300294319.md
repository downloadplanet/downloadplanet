pdf2cad is the best-selling solution for converting PDF files into industry-standard, editable CAD formats. Just select the PDF file you want to transform, specify your conversion options and convert the file into widely-supported CAD file formats, DWG, DXF and HPGL.

pdf2cad is accurate, fast and robust. It will quickly become an indispensable tool for unlocking and editing the objects and text in the PDF files you receive or archive. Whether you work in Architecture, Engineering, Construction or Manufacturing, you're probably storing and exchanging designs, schematics, floor-plans and other technical drawings in the AdobeÂ® PDF file format. CAD engineers, CNC operators, partners and supply chain members need to be able to view, test, edit or reuse these documents. pdf2cad provides the bridge. It accurately reproduces lines, shapes and text in the DXF and HPGL formats. It extracts all entities including text and supports layers with several advanced options.

The key to a successful conversion is to know what type of PDF file you are starting with. There are two types  vector PDF and raster PDF. If the PDF file was generated by another application, it is most likely a vector PDF file. This is the ideal input format for pdf2cad which will return scalable, editable vector objects and text with the highest degree of accuracy. If the PDF file is a scanned drawing, it is a raster PDF and pdf2cad is limited to raster-to-raster conversion. This will produce a reliable tracing layer for your CAD system but it will not be editable at the object layer. The only options for converting scanned drawings into editable objects include either electronic tracing with a raster-to-vector software program or through manual redrawing.

Visual Integrity is the leader in vector conversion technologies with a broad and mature product line. Since 1993, you'll find our products developer tools are relied on by some of the most demanding clients. pdf2cad is available in batch, server and developer versions, and on Linux and UNIX platforms. Other available output formats include CGM, WMF, EMF, PDF, PostScript, EPS, SVG, MIF, TIFF, GIF, JPEG, PNG, BMP, ASCII.
