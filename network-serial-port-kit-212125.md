Network Serial Port Kit allows you to share any serial port devices (bar code scanners, modems, sensors, telephone PBX systems, laboratory or industrial instruments, and so on) over the TCP/IP network or Internet.
There is also a possibility to emulate a null-modem cable over your local network or Internet. In other words you can create any number of virtual serial ports on your PC which will be connected over TCP/IP network to another PC via a virtual null-modem cable.
