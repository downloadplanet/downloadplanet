# ZylGSM (Delphi/C++Builder) - Single Developer License<br />ZylGSM is a Delphi & C++Builder component that communicates with a GSM modem and allows to you to: - send SMS in text mode - send SMS in PDU mode - dial in voice mode - dial in data mode - answer incoming call - hang up current conversation - recognize calls and identify caller number This component works with AT (Hayes) compilant GSM modems connected to one of the serial ports. You can use it also with USB, infrared and bluetooth devices, because these devices have a driver that redirects the input from the USB, infrared or bluetooth port to a virtual serial port (you can check it in System/Device Manager/Modems).<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300236097&affiliateid=200057808)
