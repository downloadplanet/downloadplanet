# MITCalc Thermal Properties of Materials<br />This workbook contains information defining the effect of temperature on some physical and mechanical properties of materials used in the engineering industry. Using this tool the following tasks can be solved:
- Calculation of the linear coefficient of thermal expansion and elongation of the component for the given heating process.
- Elongation of a group of components made of various materials arranged into a linear chain.
- Calculation of the modulus of elasticity for the given temperature.
- The database contains approximately 700 metallic materials used in mechanical engineering.
