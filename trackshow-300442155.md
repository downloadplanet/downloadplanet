# TrackShow
OfficeOne TrackShow extends PowerPoint to allow you to track the navigation of your slide show. It provides you browser-style Back, Forward and History features for your slide show. This enables you to navigate your slide show non-linearly and still go back and forth in the non-linear way.
TrackShow works with Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft PowerPoint 2019 (32-bit, 64-bit), Microsoft PowerPoint 2016 (32-bit, 64-bit), Microsoft PowerPoint 2013 (32-bit, 64-bit), Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 (32-bit and 64-bit), Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007, Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003, Microsoft PowerPoint 2002 (XP) and Microsoft PowerPoint 2000. Download and install TrackShow - it will automatically register with your PowerPoint environment. You can access TrackShow on the Slide Show tab (PowerPoint 2007 and later versions) or the Track Slide Show menu item in the Slide Show menu (PowerPoint 2003 and earlier versions).
