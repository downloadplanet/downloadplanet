# PowerPoint Password
PowerPoint Password is a password recovery tool, which comes in very handy if you forgot, lost, or misplaced your password for PowerPoint presentations (*.ppt files). Such a situation might occur if someone who does not work with you anymore password protected some vital information that is absolutely necessary to retrieve. PowerPoint password protection is based on strong crypto algorithms, so password recovery is a complex task. PowerPoint Password uses various recovery methods: Plain Dictionary and Hybrid Dictionary attacks, Brute-Force attacks, and Smart-Force (TM) attacks (this dramatically speeds up Brute-Force attacks by skipping password checks of nonsense character combinations). An easy-to-use Automatic Mode is also available.
