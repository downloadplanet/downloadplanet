Sledge Process Library is a component for Delphi (Win32, Win64) based on Graphics32 that provides a powerful user configurable process construction.
That package consists of a base, 'root' component, task components that perform the work within the process and a visual process editor component. The app. implements the tasks and the user can construct a custom process from these tasks.
There are 3 different task objects: a simple 'task' item, that receives an input and returns an output, a 'case' item that receives an input and decides at which output to continue the process, and a 'result' item, that can be used to perform an ending stage for the process. All these items' pins can be connected visually with the mouse.
The component also allows saving and loading of the process configuration, called 'preset system'.

Features:

The user can construct a custom process to run
'Task', 'Case' and 'Results' items
Powerful visual editor to define the process
Preset system for loading and saving of the defined process
Completely configurable editor appearance: colors, fonts, item sizes, icons
Easy to use Delphi style design
