Asset Tracking is an ISO 9001 compliant program to track and control calibration and preventive maintenance schedules and cost. It also tracks unscheduled maintenance providing a “fix-it-ticket” to clearly label equipment in need of repair. Reports show when calibration or maintenance is due or near due. Calibration certificates may be scanned and electronically linked for a completely paperless system.
