# Molecular Structure of the Substance
This is an educational program for the field of physics and chemistry, supported by simulations. This program is a type of graphic simulation, which is the most important element for educational purposes. The program consists of nine sequences (substance classification, molecule motion, Diffusion, Brown's motion, temperature and pressure, ideal gas, real gas, crystal structures, etc.). During every simulation, the capability exists to continuously change certain parameters (temperature, volume, etc.).
