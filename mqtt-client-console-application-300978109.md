# MQTT Client Console Application
MQTT is a Client Server publish/subscribe messaging transport protocol. It is light weight, open, simple, and designed so as to be easy to implement. These characteristics make it ideal for use in many situations, including constrained environments such as for communication in Machine to Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) contexts where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.
MQTT publish subscribe architecture
The MQTT messages are delivered asynchronously (“push”) through publish subscribe architecture.
Ideal for constrained networks
MQTT control packet headers are kept as small as possible.
MQTT 3.1.1 and 5.0
Supports MQTT 3.1.1 protocol and latest 5.0 protocol.
