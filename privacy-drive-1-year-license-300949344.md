![Privacy Drive - 1 Year License](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300949344/BIG/300949344.PNG)
Privacy Drive is easy to use encryption software that uses Virtual Disk and "on the fly" disk encryption technology to not only lock and encrypt your data, but also hide it. Whatever you want to keep away from prying eyes - photographs, videos, graphic files, documents, spreadsheets or even whole folders. All of your private information will be fully protected from unauthorized access.
Using industry-leading 256 bit encryption algorithms, Privacy Drive can create as many encrypted volumes as you need to mount as virtual disks. Once mounted they can be used as other regular hard drives. All data on the virtual disks is encrypted and unencrypted automatically before they are saved or loaded. So there's no need to encrypt or decrypt each file or folder individually.
When you have finished working with your private data and you want to lock folders and files, simply dismount the virtual disk, and everything will be instantly protected. Without the correct password, nothing from the encrypted volume can be read or accessed.
You can also share, copy and transfer your encrypted volumes via email, backup, external hard drives, CD/DVD, Cloud Servers (eg Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox or Google Drive) or any other portable storage device. This allows you to take your confidential data and information anywhere you want, without the fear of data loss or theft.
Privacy Drive supports AES 128-bit & 256-bit industry standard encryption algorithms, works on Microsoft Windows 10/8.x/7/Vista/2012/2008 (32/64-bit) and supports FAT16/FAT32/exFAT/NTFS file systems.
