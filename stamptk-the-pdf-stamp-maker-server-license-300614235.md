# STAMPtk - The PDF Stamp Maker - Server License
STAMPtk is a fast tool for creating simple PDFs that make good PDF stamps, watermarks, headers or footers.
The output from STAMPtk can then used as input to our (free) PDFtk Serverâ€™s stamp or watermark features. STAMPtk creates the stamp, then PDFtk Server applies the stamp to the PDF.
Server License Summary: Subject to the terms of this license, one STAMPtk Server License allows you to install and run STAMPtk on ONE production server and THREE development computers. It includes support, but does not allow distribution.
