# Virtual Audio Cable 3.12<br />Virtual Audio Cable is a Windows multimedia driver allowing you to transfer audio (wave) streams from one application to another. It creates a pair of Wave In/Out devices for each cable. Any application can send audio stream to Out device, and any other application can receive this stream from In device. All transfers are made digitally, providing NO sound quality loss. VAC is a "wave-version" of the "MIDI loopback cable" like MultiMid or Hubi's Loopback drivers.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300451136&affiliateid=200057808)
