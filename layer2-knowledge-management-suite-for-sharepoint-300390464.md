# Layer2 Knowledge Management Suite for SharePoint
The Layer2 Knowledge Management Suite for Microsoft SharePoint encourage knowledge workers to take advantage of the SharePoint Collaborative Knowledge Management and Social Networking features by making it as easy as possible to tag content manually and automatically, use tags for knowledge browsing, page navigation, content discovery and search:
Taxonomy Manager for SharePoint: Manage the Term Store with additional managed metadata properties (e.g. tagging rules), term set export, import and update
Tag Suggester for SharePoint: While tagging an item or document, display a suggestion list of appropriate terms based on given Term Store taxonomies, tagging rules, item properties, context and document content.
Auto Tagger for SharePoint: Tag items and documents in background without any user interaction, based on given Term Store taxonomies, tagging rules, item properties, context and document content. Auto Tagger could be helpful for initial tagging, e.g. after content migration from any system to SharePoint, as well as for daily background operation.
Tag Navigation Web Part for SharePoint: Harvest the value of collaborative tagging by using the SharePoint managed metadata taxonomy tree directly for content discovery and navigation.
Tag Directory Web Part for SharePoint: Render the SharePoint managed metadata taxonomy tree as flat A-Z directory category index directly for content discovery and navigation.
Tag Cloud Web Part for SharePoint: Navigate the content by its importance using a familiar taxonomy-based tag cloud.
Related Content Web Part for SharePoint: Automatically display related content in a given context using managed taxonomy metadata.
The solution was developed 100% based on the SharePoint Enterprise Metadata Management API and requires SharePoint Server 2010, 2013 or 2016.
