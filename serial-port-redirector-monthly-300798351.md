Serial Port Redirector allows creating virtual serial ports assigned to IP addresses and TCP-ports. Any serial communications software can use the created virtual COM port like a typical hardware COM port, to send/receive serial data to/from assigned TCP/IP address and port.
Serial Port Redirector allows connecting over local network or Internet any PC applications directly with the network enabled serial devices or other serial communications software.
