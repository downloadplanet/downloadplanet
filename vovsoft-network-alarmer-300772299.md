# Vovsoft Network Alarmer<br />Network Alarmer is a lightweight software created to offer you the ability of verifying the availability of various network devices by checking their IP address and warning you through an email message or a phone call, when something goes off course. Network Alarmer is able to check the state of the Air Conditioning machines through the user-defined IP, supporting multiple devices at once. You can even set a temperature level past which the application should send you a phone call or an email message. Similarly, you can add various other IP addresses to the PING Device IP List and the utility will verify whether they are online or not, informing you of the result through a timestamped notice in the lower part of the window.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300772299&affiliateid=200057808)
