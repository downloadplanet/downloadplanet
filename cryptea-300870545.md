# CrypTEA<br />![CrypTEA](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300870545/BIG/300870545.JPG)<br />CrypTEA is a portable file encryption tool for Windows and encrypted media viewer. It can password protect any sensitive files and document. But unlike most of the similar tools, it can directly play encrypted video and audio files, preview encrypted images or even edit encrypted text and source code, all without the need to decrypt them first.
The viewers are integrated within the app itself, without any dependencies and without leaving traces on the host computer.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300870545&affiliateid=200057808)
