So you want to write a novel? That’s fantastic, because this is probably the most complete tool for writing, plotting and style research you will ever find. How about writing in the style and language of great novelists such as Hemingway, Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, H. L. Mencken? Or perhaps adopting the vocabulary of modern Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Romance, or Mystery authors you love? Or writing fan fiction that has the same feel of the original novel? Writing Style Feedback with Style Assistants As you type, the Style Assistant instantly shows you how your favorite author uses the same word or phrase in their work and gives you recommendations if your language departs too much from their style.
