# Plugin Bridge for Photoshop<br />![Plugin Bridge for Photoshop](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300870647/BIG/300870647.JPG)<br />The 32 to 64 Plugin Bridge allows you to run most old 32-bit plugins natively and directly from inside 64-bit Adobe Photoshop.
The Plugin Bridge runs the 32-bit plugins inside a safe memory space so an unsafely written plugin cannot crash Photoshop.
