# Virtual Audio Cable 4.66
Virtual Audio Cable (VAC) is an audio bridge between applications that transmits sounds (audio streams) from app to app, from device to device. VAC creates a set of virtual audio devices. Each device simulates an audio adapter (card) whose output is internally connected to the input, making a loopback. If an application plays audio to the output, the sound will not be audible because the signal is looped back to the input. But if another application records from the input, it receives the sound produced by the first app. Such virtual devices are named Virtual Cables. The "Virtual Cable" term is used only in VAC description, as a placeholder. Actual device/endpoint names that you will see in applications' windows, are different (for example, "Line 1", "Line 2" etc.). Each side of any Virtual Cable can be used by several apps at the same time. Sounds directed to the same playback endpoint are mixed. From the recording endpoint, each app gets its own copy of the sound. VAC delivers audio signals completely inside the computer. No audio hardware is required. There is no quality loss (if no format conversion and/or volume control are involved). If all required conditions are met, audio transfer is bitperfect, suitable for audiophile applications. In well-tuned systems, signal latency is very low. VAC works in Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 and 10.
