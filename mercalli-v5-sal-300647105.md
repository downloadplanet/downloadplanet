# Mercalli V5 SAL
Mercalli V5 SAL is more than just a stabilizer; with the addition of dynamic CMOS correction to remove skew, wobble, jello, and vibration jitter that traditional stabilization software and gimbals cannot remove. Mercalli V5 SAL+ is so advanced that you no longer need to worry about holding the camera still or mounting with a gimbal. Focus on capturing the action; Mercalli V5 SAL+ can make it look great.
