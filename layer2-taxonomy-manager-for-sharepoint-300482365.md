Offers a complete taxonomy life-cycle management application to import, create, deploy, improve and export corporate taxonomies using various formats, including SKOS. Custom term properties, classification rules etc.
Taxonomy-based item and document classification in SharePoint helps users to find the information they need much faster, it gives context to the cloud, connect users to social networks, provides portal-wide activity feeds and enables a new way to access information â€“ independent of the storage location. The Taxonomy Manager offers a complete taxonomy life-cycle management application to import, create, deploy, improve and export terms. Additionally it extends the term store to add more advanced attribute to terms, like classification rules or related terms. Tag classification rules are used for automated or semi-automated content classification tools like Auto-Tagger and Tag Suggester.
Features & Benefits:
