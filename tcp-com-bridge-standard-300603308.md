# TCP COM Bridge Standard<br />![TCP COM Bridge Standard](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300603308/BIG/300603308.PNG)<br />TCP COM Bridge is a utility program that works as an RS232-TCP/IP software converter and allows to forward data from a physical or virtual COM port to an Ethernet network. Using this program, you can turn any computer into a "serial device server." TCP COM Bridge lets you create a connection between two COM ports on two different computers, even via the Internet. This way, you can build distributed data collection systems using legacy software that supports COM ports only.

This version allows to create 2 connections only and can't work in the service mode. Please, read about version features here.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300603308&affiliateid=200057808)
