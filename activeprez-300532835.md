ActivePrez provides you with a powerful extension to PowerPoint that allows you to add a menu bar to your slides that overcomes the PAGE-UP/PAGE-DOWN limitation of PowerPoint. Now you can navigate a PowerPoint presentation like you would navigate a web site. Add links to slides, custom show, next/previous navigation and URLs. Use the Wizard to quickly generate menus in seconds based on PowerPoint sections or section header slides.
