# TestPath
TestPath is designed to check the files you write/burn on a new CD-R or DVD, although you can check any two paths. Now you can be sure that all files that you wrote to the disk are there and without write errors. The program reads all the files in the source path and its subdirectories and then compares them with the files in the destination path. The program will then report the missing files in the destination path and report files with differences. Different comparing options, such as 'compare by file time' and 'do fast comparing' are also available.
