# CircleTools<br />OfficeOne CircleTools extends PowerPoint to allow you to arrange a bunch of shapes in circular layout. You define the size of the circle and OfficeOne CircleTools places the shapes on the circumference of a circle of that size. You can optionally choose to tell CircleTools to rotate each shape to make the shape follow the circumference. This gives rise to cool effects, limited only by your imagination, that you can create in your presentations.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300460203&affiliateid=200057808)
