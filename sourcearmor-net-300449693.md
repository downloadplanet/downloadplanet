This includes overloaded renaming of types, methods, events, properties, parameters, fields and events, resources, encryption of strings, control flow obfuscation, metadata pruning, insertion of invalid IL instructions, suppression of disassemblers and many other techniques.

SourceArmor supports all versions of .NET framework and all platforms (x86, AnyCpu and x64). It also supports obfuscation of mixed .NET applications (with both managed and unmanaged code) and precompiled ASP .NET WEB applications.

In this way PC Guard for .NET (binary encryption, copy protection and licensing) and SourceArmor .NET (source code obfuscation) present total software security and licensing solution for .NET framework applications.
