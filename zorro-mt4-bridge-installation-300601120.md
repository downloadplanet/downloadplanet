# Zorro MT4 Bridge Installation
The MT4 bridge allows Zorro to appear in the MT4(TM) client terminal as an Expert Advisor (EA) and this way trade with all MT4 brokers on demo and real accounts. It's automatically included in Zorro S, but can also be separately subscribed here. This product includes a remote installation of a ready-to-run Zorro based trading system on your Windows VPS. The installation service takes about one hour. The latest Zorro version will be installed and connected to MT4 if present on the VPS. After installation, strategies can be immediately started and traded.
