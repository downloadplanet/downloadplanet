Let your CD or DVD automatically open your documents or display a menu when your disk is inserted into the user's computer. Create autorun disks in a few clicks, no design or programming required! All you need to do is to specify your documents, web pages and presentations in this easy step-by-step wizard. You can create autorun disks from scratch or add autorun capabilities to the files already prepared for your CD.
