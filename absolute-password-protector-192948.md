# Absolute Password Protector
Absolute Password Protector is a strong encryption utility that securely encrypts files. Encrypted containers can be used to safely send files over the Internet via e-mail. With the use of Absolute Password Protector, you can also hide encrypted files so that no one would know it's an encrypted file.
Absolute Password Protector adds "invisible" noise to digital photographic images. This noise will contain your sensitive data in an encrypted form. There are a lot of password protection utilities on the market today that promise a secure storage for your files. Unfortunately, simple password protection techniques do not guarantee safety and passwords are easily recovered. LastBit Software is a company providing password recovery solutions since 1997. We have a great experience in this field and did our best to make our encryption utility as strong as possible.
While, for security reasons, it is not recommended that you use short passwords when encrypting files, short passwords are easier to remember and type. Absolute Password Protector uses the CleverLock (TM) technology that dramatically increases the time and efforts needed to break even a short password. So, maximum possible brute-force attack speed is about 100 passwords per second (for example, search speed for Zip archives is up to tens of millions of passwords per second). Thus short six characters length alphanumerical password will take about 8 months to break. Minimal safe password length: 5 for mixed-case alphanumeric passwords, 6 for single-case alphanumeric passwords, 7 for single-case letters-only passwords. Recommended password length: 6+ mixed-case alphanumeric, 7+ for single-case alphanumeric or letters-only passwords.
There is no need to start the program each time you wish to encrypt or decrypt a file. Absolute Password Protector integrates into the Windows shell and can be invoked by a right click on a file, while in Windows Explorer. Encrypt files with a single mouse click!
