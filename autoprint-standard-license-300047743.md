# AutoPrint Standard License
Automated print-out of PDF documents, BMP, JPG and TIF graphic files and simple TXT or RTF files. RAW print files from other applications are also supported. As a background application AutoPrint sends files to one or more different local or public Windows network printers. You no longer need to load your documents into huge applications and clicking around to print them out, file by file. Also very useful when having print-out trouble with DOS- or other OS-applications running on workstations connected to a Windows network. Android app Photos-On-Air directly connects your mobile device to AutoPrint.
