# PDF Version Converter Command Line Version
Convert PDF file between different versions for compatibility purpose. Every PDF file is generated or produced according to a specification. This specification has evolved from version 1.0 to version 1.7. Sometimes users are faced with the dilemma that a certain application only recognizes a specific version of PDF file. For example, some journal publishers only accept submission of PDF files of version 1.4 or later, some obsolete Windows applications only read PDF files of version 1.2. Suppose you have a PDF file of version 1.1, what would you like to do? PDF Version Converter is the answer. This software utility enables you to convert PDF files between different versions, PDF version 1.0 (Adobe Acrobat 1.x) PDF version 1.1 (Adobe Acrobat 2.x) PDF version 1.2 (Adobe Acrobat 3.x) PDF version 1.3 (Adobe Acrobat 4.x) PDF version 1.4 (Adobe Acrobat 5.x) PDF version 1.5 (Adobe Acrobat 6.x) PDF version 1.6 (Adobe Acrobat 7.x) PDF version 1.7 (Adobe Acrobat 8.x, 9.x, ISO 32000) You may notice that the actual file size of the generated PDF file after conversion is a little different from the original, simply because different PDF specifications differ in structuring and organizing the objects in a PDF file.
