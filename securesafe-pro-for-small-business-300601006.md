If you are having problems remembering all your access passwords and logins, would like to protect yourself against identity theft and need a reliable software solution to store files with confidential information in one place safely and securely, you need to get SecureSafe P. Sure, it may sound like a sales push, but you'll change your mind once you try it. After all, great software sells itself.
And here is why:
First, SecureSafe Pro is 100% free to download and try. Second, it uses military-grade encryption standard approved and used by the US Department of Defense (namely AES, Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit key). Third, it frees you from having to remember all of your passwords and logins. They are stored in a database tree, which is very easy to search and navigate. When you visit a site you need access to, simply click SecureSafe Pro icon conveniently located in the system tray, enter your access password and that's it. Never check "Remember my login and password" box on websites, since this is not safe and may lead to hackers getting access to your private information, or worse yet - stealing your identity. Use SecureSafe Pro instead. Moreover, the program comes with a number of safety precautions, like unloading access data if program is left idle. Plus, it has a "tough password generator" feature. Fourth, this program is not just another password keeper. You can store regular files inside the program. The program can store any file and all files can be launched from SecureSafe Pro. The files stored with SecureSafe Pro won't be visible and accessible to anybody but you.
There are no limits to how many entries you can store and the program is incredibly easy to use.
