Encodes WAV/RF64 and audio file formats supported by BASS: WAV/RF64, AIFF, MP3, MP2, MP1, Ogg Vorbis (and formats supported by BASS plugins) and OS supported formats like AAC/MP4, Flac, etc. to MP3 format.

Features:
Encode various audio file formats into MP3 format
COM class usable by developer environments/platforms supporting COM classes
Stream encoding interface (send sample data to the component and receive the encoded MP3 data)
Optional lowpass and highpass filtering
Supports using the LAMEEncoder.dll itself natively without COM
As no external .exe is started the library is usable for Windows Store apps

Shareware License: for usage of the component in an unlimited number of your shareware software.
Commercial License: for usage of the component in a single commercial product.
For the shareware license, the product must sell for no more than â‚¬40 each. The price limit can be raised by purchasing duplicate licences, eg. 2 licences doubles it.
When using the BASS method (with bass.dll and bass_fx.dll) you also need a separate license for BASS from http://www.un4seen.com/.
In all other cases there are no royalties to pay, and you can use all future updates without further cost, all you need to do is just obtain the newest version.
