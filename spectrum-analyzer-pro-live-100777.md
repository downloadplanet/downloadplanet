This sophisticated piece of software turns your computer into a modern, State-of-The-Art spectrum analyzer giving you features that go far beyond the possibilities of any stand-alone hardware unit. An important advantage of your new analyzer software is the fact that your computer monitor is a far better means of displaying analyzer measurments than any LED or LCD bar. By making use of standard computer operations your analyzer software will store your personal settings or analyze audio data you may have previously recorded. What we had in mind while developing the PAS Analyzer was maximum flexibility, so we decided to equip it with it´s own test tone oscillator.While the analyzer is connected to your soundcard´s input the oscillator signal is feeding the outputs. Of course there is more than a 1 khz sine wave in the oscillator, it`s actually giving you various waveforms and noise. In Compare Mode the output of your soundcard is constantly being checked against what´s coming in at the card´s input sockets allowing you to evaluate the quality of any given signal chain. Now let me give you some real life examples for the use of the PAS Analyzer: · Detecting and eliminating room modes ( sound reinforcement ) · Checking the stereo bus signal in mixdown · Single track examination · Serving as a mobile measuring instrument ( e.g on a Notebook PC ) · Test tone oscillator for tape machine alignment · Measuring gain or attenuation using Compare Mode · Measuring the frequency response of a signal chain by using sinewaves of different frequencies I´m sure, you can think of various other applications for the PAS Analyzer.
