Actual Title Buttons is intended both for home and corporate users who would like to optimize daily window management chores by utilizing the hidden power of modern operating systems with just one mouse-click!
Actual Title Buttons lets you add the new Minimize to Tray, Rollup, Stay-on-Top, Change Transparency and many other buttons to any program's title bar next to the Windows standard Minimize/Maximize/Close buttons.
The new buttons are as easy to use as the standard ones: you can minimize any window to system tray, force it to stay on top of other windows, make it semi-transparent, or roll up it with a single mouse click.
The Minimize to Tray feature lets you save the taskbar space by hiding window to a tray icon. Make your own taskbar less cluttered and more handy!
The Stay on Top feature brings the window to the top of the desktop and doesn't allow other windows to hide it. Don't let these windows annoy you when you busy!
The Make Transparent feature lets you apply transparency effect from 0% (fully transparent) to 100% (solid) rate to any program such as Instant Messenger, Notepad, Outlook Express and others in Windows 2000/XP.
The Roll up\Unroll feature lets you minimize windows so only the title bars remain visible. You won't have to hunt for the windows you were using!
Actual Title Buttons can be useful for working with e-mail clients (MS Outlook Express, Eudora etc.), messenger programs (Windows/MSN Messenger, Yahoo Messenger! etc.), text editors (Notepad, Windows Word) and offline browsers and ftp-clients and many other kinds of programs.
You can add new title buttons to all windows in your system as well as configure every program's windows to different options! Configure any window to suit your tastes!
Actual Title Buttons now has multilingual support. It supports English, German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian and others!
