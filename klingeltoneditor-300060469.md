# Klingelton-Editor
Create your own ringtones for your realtone mobile! Read in a track from an audio CD or open an existing mp3 or wav file from your hard disk. You can cut out unimportant parts, change the volume and speed and use effects like echo. Cross fade the end to the beginning for smooth playback in a loop. Now you can save the ringtone as extrem small mp3 file (about 60 kbytes per minute). You can then send the mp3 file to your realtone mobile
