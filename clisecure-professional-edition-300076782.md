# CliSecure - Professional Edition
CliSecure offers real protection for your intellectual property, it does so by encrypting the IL code stored in your assemblies. During execution the code is handed to the jitter in its decrypted form just before compilation occurs. The CliSecure execution engine assures that at most a single method will reside in memory in its decrypted form in any given time. This makes it impossible to reconstruct your original assembly by using memory dump tools.
