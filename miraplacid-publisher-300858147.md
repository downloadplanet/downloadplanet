# Miraplacid Publisher<br />With Miraplacid Publisher software you can convert (print) any document to an image or web presentation. Anyone can open your document across a broad range of hardware and software, and it will look exactly as you intended - with layout, fonts, and images intact. No one can modify or copy and paste your texts. After installation on your PC, Miraplacid Publisher appears as a new virtual printer in your system. All the documents you print to this 'printer' will be opened in a preview dialog. You scale the image, adjust hue, saturation and value, get rid of unused white borders, and do some other image processing. Then you can save resulting images to disk, upload to FTP or HTTP server, email, or print them to a real printer. Miraplacid Publisher supports following output formats: PDF, JPEG, GIF, TIFF, BMP, PNG, TGA and Web Presentation. When redirecting to a printer, reduce saturation to save color cartridge or increase value to save black ink. Use borders detector in manual mode to set printing area when you need to print only the document part you need. Miraplacid Publisher is integration-ready software. All the settings can be easily managed from your software or script.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300858147&affiliateid=200057808)
