# Slide Show Duo<br />Slide Show Duo allows you to display 2 consecutive PowerPoint slides on a single display. This allows your users to retain more information from your previous slide and connect with the flow of your presentation.
Too much information on each slide can mean that your message loses its impact. Slide Show Duo allows you to show two slides at the same time to DOUBLE the impact, DOUBLE audience engagement and DOUBLE your success! All without changing how you create presentations. If you have an interactive device (interactive whiteboard, interactive projector, pen panel, etc) then you can add annotations to the most recent slide.
OfficeOne Slide Show Duo works with Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 (32-bit), Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007, Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003, Microsoft PowerPoint 2002 (XP) and Microsoft PowerPoint 2000. Download and install Slide Show Duo - it will automatically register with your PowerPoint environment.
