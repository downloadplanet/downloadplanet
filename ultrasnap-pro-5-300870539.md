UltraSnap PRO, our graphic clipboard processor and a screen capture.
It has full non-destructive WYSIWYG editor, with multiple anti-aliasing for perfect output, with many effects like shadows, bevels, objects and more.


UltraSnap is an excellent tool not only for office application such as preparing tutorials, manuals, web graphics and screen shots but also for everyday use for example to quickly create a little scrapbook postcard or collage from few photos and then sending them by e-mail or post it to blog.
The main idea is that all is done quickly, without opening or saving files. Just go to Edit Mode, then simply use a shortcut to capture few photos one after another from your image viewer like Google Picasa or Windows Image Viewer, arrange them, add text, sharpen the whole thing and then paste it to your email or save as a file - all is done directly from clipboard and using comfortable WYSIWYG editing.
Quick mode

Press Hot-key to capture single image even on multiple-monitors, adjust the size, the sharpness, add drop shadow, add a text below the image. You don't have to create intermediate files, all the changes are back in the windows clipboard ready to be pasted in your application. At this point you may paste it to your application, save it to disk or switch to full editing mode.
Batch Processor

The best thing is that the quick effects are like a properties. Once you set them you don't have to repeat these steps for the next image again! The next image you capture will automatically have applied the resizing, sharpness and all the effects. As soon as you capture the screen, the new processed image is in clipboard and it can be automatically saved to disk as well. This is a huge time-saver for number of similar screen captures for tutorials or manuals.

Full WYSIWYG Editing mode

We were tired of going to editing program to combine multiple captures or photos into one image, adding cursors, texts, captions or arrows. So we build full WYSIWYG editor directly into UltraSnap.
