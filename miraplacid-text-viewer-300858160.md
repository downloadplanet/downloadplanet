# Miraplacid Text Viewer
Miraplacid Text Viewer is a visual tool for structured text files internals analysis. It represents file structure as a tree. Viewer highlighted selected tree item in the text viewer panel. A character selected in a viewer can be looked up in the tree. Viewer has search and navigation functionality, and can save selected fragment of text to a file. How it works: of course, it cannot be done without knowing the file format. Both Miraplacid Text DOM and Miraplacid Text Viewer rely on Miraplacid Text Data Definition (.tdd) files, which contain definitions for internal text file structure. All the .tdd files included into the Miraplacid software package, as well as all the .tdd files posted on a community web site http://BinoPedia.org are licensed under Creative Commons Share Alike CC BY-SA 3.0. This license permits you to modify .tdd files and use them in commercial products. If you need to use this text data manipulation technology in your own software, this is possible with Miraplacid Binary and Text DOM SDK, which provides .Net 2.0 - compatible library (BinaryDOM.dll), documentation and examples. Platform: Microsoft Dotnet 4.0.
