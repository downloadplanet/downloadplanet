Smart1DCutting is a professional software package designed for length cutting optimization. Using advanced algorithms, it generates the most optimized cutting layouts, providing for maximum material yield. Smart1DCutting may be used for any linear material types such as bars, pipes, profiles, cables etc.

Smart1DCutting works fast even with large number of parts. We tested Smart1DCutting on a large job consisting of 2140 parts! The testing machine was equiped with an AMD Duron 1100 MHz processor and 256 MB RAM memory. The cutting layout was computed by Smart1DCutting in less than 10 seconds and the average usage was 96%.
