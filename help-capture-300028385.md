# Help Capture
Help Capture is a program useful for anyone why needs to write software documentation, give end user assistance on a regular basis or for teaching purposes. Help Capture supports the creation of user documentation pages combining screenshots and texts captured from a running application. It supports the creation of the three main types of user aid. Tutorial: the user is guided through each step of accomplishing particular tasks. Reference: all controls on the captured form are described, logically grouped. This approach is typically used when the sister product Help Generator automatically generates a complete help system from an application. Thematic: a thematic approach, where chapters or sections concentrate on one particular area of interest.
