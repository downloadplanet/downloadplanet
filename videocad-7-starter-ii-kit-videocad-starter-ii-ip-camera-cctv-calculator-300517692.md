# VideoCAD 7 Starter II Kit (VideoCAD Starter II + IP Camera CCTV Calculator)<br />With VideoCAD 7 Starter II you can: Choose the most suitable lenses, heights and locations for camera installation to provide the required parameters of view areas. Calculate the horizontal projection sizes of view areas to draw them on the location plan. Display by separate colors different regions of spatial resolution and field-of-view size. Choose visually a relative location of cameras using the graphics window with CAD interface. Locate cameras on the prepared layouts in *.bmp, *.jpg, AutoCAD *.dwg, AutoCAD *.dxf formats. Obtain a drawing containing horizontal projections of site layout with camera images, calculated view areas, and with coordinate grid to be used in graphical path of the project. Export the obtained drawing into any of the following formats: *.bmp, *.jpg. Saving the drawing in the Graphics windows with resolution exceeding Windows screen resolution. Copy the Camera list with most important parameters to MS Excel, MS Word and other software. Construct three dimensional models of real scenes. Use many 3D models (people, cars, bus, furniture, turnstile, tree, grass). You can add other 3D models from 3ds max and Google Sketchup. Spare the means and win tenders due to the reduction of cameras' quantity in projects and increase of their efficiency. Reduce time expended and boost design quality. Cut down the amount of controversial situations with customers and accelerate their solution.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300517692&affiliateid=200057808)
