# Account Pro Lite
User-friendly accounting and finance planning program, equally suitable for small to medium businesses, institutions, and private users. ACCOUNT PRO is multi-system (Anglo-American and European), multi-currency, and multilingual and can be installed in English, German, French, Spanish, Danish, Italian or Dutch. The program is based on the principle of double entry bookkeeping. It is capable of networking, handles up to 2000 client accounts, and it has a function for automatic entry of tax and discount transactions.
ACCOUNT PRO comes with a number of standard charts of accounts. These can very easily be adapted to particular user requirements. Unneeded accounts can be deleted and any additionally required ones can easily be inserted anywhere in the charts.
Accounting with ACCOUNT PRO is very easy. As opposed to 'normal' accounting programs, where erroneous entries must be neutralized (canceled) and corrected by additional entries, ACCOUNT PRO allows direct correction of such entries. Furthermore, ACCOUNT PRO avoids the terms 'Debit' and 'Credit' for data entry. Instead, an amount sign is used, which makes data entry faster and easier. Nevertheless, the displays and printouts of ACCOUNT PRO are in accordance with normal accounting terminology.
In addition to the normal accounting capabilities, ACCOUNT PRO has special capabilities that allow efficient financial planning and forecasting. Not only monthly budgets, but also monthly forecasts can be entered for every expense and revenue account. Monthly and yearly planning reports facilitate an overview of the system as a whole. With these features, realistic forecasts of the financial result at the end of the accounting period can be made at any time.
The program's data capacities are as follows:
- 2,000 accounting systems
- 20,000 accounts per system
- 200,000(double-entry) transactions per system and business year
- 200 standard transactions
