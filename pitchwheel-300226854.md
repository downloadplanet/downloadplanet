# Pitchwheel<br />![Pitchwheel](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300226854/BIG/300226854.JPG)<br />The Pitchwheel plug-in changes the pitch of a sound without changing it's length. It has a large, easy to use dial and simple parameters making it a fast and creative effect unit. It has a range of two semi-tones to two octaves, which gives you control from subtle tuning changes to wild swings of pitch. The user pointer acts as a desired pitch change, and the actual pitch is produced by smoothing and inertia controls. Pitchwheel moves towards the desired pitch at sample accuracy, enabling nice transitions without stepping. A DJ turntable feel can be created with some play, but the difference here is that the tempo remains the same, so your track can go on without sequence timing changes.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300226854&affiliateid=200057808)
