# ADO.Net DAC for Delphi<br />ADO.Net DAC for Delphi is the fastest and most reliable database connectivity solutions for any database using ADO.Net technology in Delphi. It provides data access to data sources such as SQL Server, Oracle, SQLite, VistaDB and to data sources exposed through OLE DB and ODBC using ADO.Net data provider framework. ADO.Net VCL for Delphi is an enterprise solution with highest performance and unlimited possibilities. Data-sharing consumer applications can use ADO.NET VCL for Delphi to connect to these data sources and retrieve, handle, and update the data that they contain. With its powerful common architecture base on ADO.Net technology, ADO.Net VCL for Delphi enables high-speed direct data access from Delphi to SQL Server, Oracle, SQLite, VistaDB and other data sources exposed through OLE DB and ODBC. ADO.Net VCL for Delphi provides a library of components for connecting to a database, executing commands, and retrieving results. Those results are either processed directly, placed in a Virtual Table components. The Virtual Table component can also be used independently of any active connection to manage data local to the application or sourced from XML. You have the choice of either using client-side or server-side cursors. The ADO.Net VCL for Delphi actually handle the work of cursors. The developer has the freedom of choice in development, for creating efficient applications.

The ADO.Net DAC for Delphi consists of the following library of Data Access components:
SqlClient Data Access Components
OracleClient Data Access Components
SQLite Data Access Components
ODBC Data Access Components
OLE DB Data Access Components
VistaDB Data Access Components
Data & Grid Components
Virtual Table Components

Note: Direct Data Access components for the following data sources will be available in future: MySQL, Firebird, BD2, Informix etc. However, you can still connect to these data sources using ODBC Data Access Components or OLEDB Data Access Components provided ODBC drivers or OLE DB providers are installed on the client machine.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300850332&affiliateid=200057808)
