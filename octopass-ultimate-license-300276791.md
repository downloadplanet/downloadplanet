OctoPASS: Distributed Password Recovery
OctoPass is a new powerful password recovery system made for recovering forgotten or lost passwords using distributed computing. The current version supports brute force attack only.
  Password Recovery is extremely resource-consuming task. If a password protection is well done, brute force attack may be the only recovery method available. If the password is long enough, it may take a lot of time to break it. By using the power of multiple computers, you can reduce the recovery time. OctoPASS first of all, targets security professionals and forensic examinators. Naturally, utilizing OctoPASS makes sense only when several computers are available. The more computers you have, the higher search speed and better results you obtain.
