WinCatalog is an easy to use yet powerful tool that can be used for cataloging disks and files. Using WinCatalog you can quickly find a needed file in your disk collection, even without inserting any removable disks into the drives.
The program keeps the record of all files and folders stored on a disk and then uses this data to help find the needed files. WinCatalog supports various disk formats: CD, DVD, hard drives, removable and network drives, flash drives and any other storage devices, that can be accessed as drives in MS Windows environment.
WinCatalog's main asset is the ability to access any disk's table of contents even if the disk is inaccessible at the moment. You can view the list of files and folders, examine their properties and descriptions, search files by various criteria.
You can increase the search relevancy by associating with each file (folder, disks) a set of keywords and a description that characterizes this item.
WinCatalog features a built-in list of contacts. Use it to monitor whom of your friends or acquaintances you have given a certain disk. The lent disks are marked with a special icon. You can also exchange information about your CD collection with friends.
