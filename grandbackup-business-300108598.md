# GrandBackup Business<br />SmartBackup copies files and folders from one location to another on the same drive, another drive, or across the network. You can set up Tasks that describe the source location, the destination location, and the frequency at which you want to copy the files. SmartBackup monitors the source files for changes or additions and then automatically copies the new or changed files to their designated destinations. The program uses the familiar Windows Explorer interface. The Task setup dialog box is easy and intuitive, that makes configuration jobs a snap. Advanced options include PKZip-compatible compression, password protection, directory synchronization, and background thread priority control. You can also include or exclude a specific file or set of files from the copy and keep any number of old versions of files. Once you configure the Tasks in terms of files and locations, the program sits as an icon in the Windows system tray and unobtrusively copies files in the background so you will allways have an up-to-date backup when you need it.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300108598&affiliateid=200057808)
