BASS Threaded Mixer Library is a BASS add-on that implements a BASS mixer channel which mixes the pluged-in source channels in separate parallel threads to be used with professional low-latency ASIO output.
The more sources are added and the more DSP/processing is needed for the sources the more effective the library is compared to single threaded processing.
The library is especially useful for CPUs that have limited single-core performance but have a lot of cores, like the octa-core AMD CPUs.

Features:
Add any number of source channels to the mixer
When only 1 source is plugged-in no threading is performed
Achieve nearly real-time low-latency with heavy DSP/processing of the sources
