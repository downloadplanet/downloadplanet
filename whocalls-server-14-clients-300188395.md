# WhoCalls (Server 1..4 clients)<br />WhoCalls will use your modem to detect the CallerID of a calling party. It will not answer the call, just display the caller information (if transmitted). If the caller is already in the database, its details and photo will be displayed. You may also use it to display information in an external database. Samples of a Call Center in MsAccess, Excel and Outlook are included.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300188395&affiliateid=200057808)
