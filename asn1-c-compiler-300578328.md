# ASN.1 C++ Compiler
The ASN.1 C++ Compiler is a plus version of ASN.1 C Compiler, utilizing object-oriented programming techniques. The ASN.1 C++ Compiler automatically translates ASN.1 specifications into C++ classes as well as metadata for encoding/decoding. In addition to the ASN.1 C++ Compiler, ASN.1 C++ Runtime Library is also part of the package. The ASN.1 C++ Runtime Library is designed as a set of common functions for encoding and decoding the base ASN.1 types (BOOLEAN, INTEGER, etc.) and a rich collection of utility functions to operate on application messages. The ASN.1 C++ Runtime Library is also meta-orient, that is, the metadata is loaded at runtime, and can be freed after usage.
