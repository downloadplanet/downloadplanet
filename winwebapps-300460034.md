# WinWebApps<br />WinWebApps allows you to embed web applications and display them as standalone applications on Windows. Your web application can be developed using any of the Web technologies including HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. WinWebApps displays your application in an embedded web browser, which gets installed with Microsoft Internet Explorer.
Provide it with the URL of your web application and the properties of the Window in which the web browser will be embedded. Save the WinWebApp to a file by clicking the Save... button. You can now launch your web application directly from Windows through the saved WinWebApp file. WinWebApp will read the saved file and load the URL in the embedded Web Browser. You can redistribute the saved WinWebApp file and it can run on the machines where WinWebApp is installed.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300460034&affiliateid=200057808)
