Proxy Manager lets you send emails from Outlook using any alias (proxy) SMTP address with an arbitrary display name from your Exchange account, hosted or on-premises.
There are no server components, everything is done on the client side - just install Proxy Manager, and you are ready to go! Select the address to send from and click the Send button.
All you have to do is specify the SMTP server name and password once. If you are using a hosted Exchange mailbox, Proxy Manager knows how to handle most popular hosting providers, such as Office 365, AppRiver, NetVigour, GoDaddy, etc.. For an on-premises installation, you would need to know the SMTP server name and the password. Proxy Manager will take care of everything else!
  New in version 3.0: per-email address signatures are now supported!
