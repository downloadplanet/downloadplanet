Anybody can use this software effectively and painlessly: re-sizable display lets you set the optimal size of digits, hotkeys and 'always on top' mode let you manage the stopwatch directly from any application. But XNote Stopwatch is more than just a stopwatch or timer. It can make "snapshots" of time (split/lap control as in usual stopwatches) and keep the records (including notes you may enter), so that later you can use it for any necessary calculations. If you perform discontinuous time measures, you can save/load sessions, "rewind" time back or fast-forward to any point. By default XNote Stopwatch counts time up to 1/100 of second, however you can change it to any number of events per second (as in TV frames - 24/25/60) and even get rid off decimals at all. Despite variety of features, the software has small size, low system resource requirements, and fast execution speed!
