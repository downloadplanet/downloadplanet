# VideoCAD 8 Lite
With VideoCAD 7 Lite you can: Choose the most suitable lenses, heights and locations for camera installation to provide the required parameters of view areas. Calculate the horizontal projection sizes of view areas to draw them on the location plan. Display by separate colors and hatch styles different regions of spatial resolution and field-of-view size. Choose visually a relative location of cameras using the graphics window with CAD interface. Locate cameras and cables on the prepared layouts in *.bmp, *.jpg, *.emf, *.wmf, *.png, *.gif, *.tif, AutoCAD *.dwg, *.dxf formats. To import *.dwg and *.dxf files the CAD Import module by CAD Soft Tools http://www.cadsofttools.com was used. Obtain a drawing containing two projections of site layout with the camera images, calculated view areas and cables, and with coordinate grid and titles to be used in graphical path of the project as well. Print the obtained drawing on one or several pages. You can use prepared frames with standard title-Block and logo. Export the obtained drawing into any of the following formats: *.bmp, *.jpg, *.emf, *.wmf, *.png, *.gif, *.tif, AutoCAD *.dxf (R14), *.dxf (R2000). Obtain a text file with full description of all cameras in project, view areas and cables to be pasted into a project explanatory note or used as instruction for installation. Construct three dimensional models of real scenes with the possibility of loading prepared 3D models (a person, a car, etc.). You can add your own 3D models from 3ds max and Google Sketchup. Design operator interface using the Monitor window. Calculate the length and electric parameters of cables. Spare the means and win tenders due to the reduction of cameras' quantity in projects and increase of their efficiency. Reduce time expended and boost design quality. Cut down the amount of controversial situations with customers and accelerate their solution.
