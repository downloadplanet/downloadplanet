Copying music and other media files from iDevice to the PC is not an easy thing. Creating backups of music, videos and playlists is almost impossible asthere is no software giving you the opportunity to transfer the music from your iDevice to your Desktop. iSkysoft TunesOver gives you the chance to copy all of your media files from the iDevice to the iTunes Library,your PC and, unlike iTunes, even to another iDevice with ease. It also lets you sync ripped audio and easily transfer album artwork and music information,options that iTunes does not offer.

**Share the Music You Have Collected without being bound by iTunes.

iTunes applies a number of restrictions on the sharing of music that is recorded on your iDevice. You will find it impossible to transfer the music collection you have on your iPod, iPad or iPhone to your PC or any other device. TunesOver gives you the opportunity to bypass all of the restrictions of iTunes and share your music collection across all of your devices with consummate ease. Moreover, the audio quality of the music files would remain the same after the transfer and you will find it to be exactly the same as it was on your iDevice.
