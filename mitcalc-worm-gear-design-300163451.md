# MITCalc Worm gear design<br />The calculation is used for geometrical and strength designs and worm gearing check. The program solves the following tasks:
- Calculation of gearing dimensions.
- Automatic transmission design with minimum input requirements.
- Design for safety coefficients entered.
- Calculation of a table of proper solutions.
- Calculation of complete geometrical parameters.
- Calculation of strength parameters, safety check.
- Gearing design for precise centre-line distance.
- Auxiliary calculations (heating, shaft design).
- Support of 2D and 3D CAD systems.
The calculations use procedures, algorithms and data from standards ANSI, ISO, DIN, BS and specialized literature.
List of standards: ANSI/AGMA 6022-C93 (Revision of AGMA 341.02), ANSI/AGMA 6034-B92 (Revision of ANSI/AGMA 6034-A87), DIN 3996, DIN 3975-1, DIN 3975-2<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300163451&affiliateid=200057808)
