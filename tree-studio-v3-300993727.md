# Tree Studio v3<br />![Tree Studio v3](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300993727/BIG/300993727.PNG)<br />Tree Studio is a product born from TwistedBrush Pro Studio but with a focus on 2D tree creation with a simpler, streamlined interface. Internally the same great TwistedBrush brush engine is used but with a single focus of making it easy to create trees of specific types. Tree Studio has pairs of brushes for each tree type - one for the frame and one for the leaves. The frame is algorithmically generated so it will be different each time. This allows you to create an endless variety of each tree type.
