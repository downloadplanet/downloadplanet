Virtual Serial Port Kit creates virtual serial ports and connects each pair of them via a virtual null-modem cable.
All the data written to one virtual serial port can be immediately read from the other one, and vice versa.
So, your applications can exchange data just like they do via hardware serial ports and real null-modem cables.
