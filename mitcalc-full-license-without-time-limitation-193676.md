# MITCalc (Full license without time limitation)<br />MITCalc is the mechanical, industrial and technical calculations package. This professionally multi-language prepared package includes solutions for gearings, belt and chain drives, springs, beams, shafts, bolt joints and many others. The calculations support both Imperial and Metric units and are processed particularly according to US, many European and Japanese standards. The sophisticated interaction with many 2D CAD systems (AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, IntelliCAD, Ashlar Graphite, TurboCAD) allows the relevant drawing to be developed in a few seconds. MITCalc is developed in Microsoft Excel. It allows not only easy user-defined modifications and expansions but also mutual interconnection of the calculations, which is unique in the development of tailor-made complex calculations.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=193676&affiliateid=200057808)
