vicons have been designed by a professional graphic designer using the same visual language, making their use as a family within presentations, documents and spreadsheets easy. The intuitive search function allows you to search by text or numeric ID of the icon, a complete list being available in PDF format which can also be accessed from the ribbon. And because the icons are vectors (as opposed to bitmaps) you can scale them infinitely without loss of quality and edit their style using the standard Microsoft Office tools such as fill, outline, shadow, bevel, glow, 3D and other effects. vicons is compatible with all versions of Office that use the ribbon interface e.g. MSO 2007, 2010, 2013 and runs on 64 bit versions of Office as well as 32 bit.
