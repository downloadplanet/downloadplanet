# PDF Page Size Split 2
PDF Page Size Split is an Acrobat plug-in tool for full commercial version of Acrobat which is used to split pdf pages on page size, so for example you could have a PDF with 15 pages of A3 and 5 pages of A4, PDF Page Size Split will split the pdf into two files:- one for A3 and one for A4 pages, then you can print all the A4 pdf's without interruption or store them away in your archives on page size, this also makes viewing pdf's much easier. An optional matching size table is also included that matches metric size to the ISO standard paper size, for example: 210x297 is A4, you can also specify your own custom sizes & size ranges, the ISO name is then appended onto the output filename so you can later quickly find your documents without knowing all the ISO metric paper sizes & your custom size descriptions. Optional color split option as well as page size split and optional re-merge option for merging the split files back together after splitting.
All updates to v2.xx are free.
