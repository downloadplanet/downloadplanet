Gamestudio team editions are multi-seat licenses for developer teams or educational purposes. All users of a team edition must use the software for the same project or for educational purposes, and may not use it for separate projects or outside the team or classroom. The Team Edition does not include the license to publish and distribute projects - for this an additional normal edition is required.

Team Editions are available for 3 or more seats at a fraction of the normal edition price. For ordering, please click [Add to Card] and then enter the desired number of seats under 'Quantity'. For a Team Edition upgrade from A7, please enter the same number of seats as your previous A7 Team Edition.
