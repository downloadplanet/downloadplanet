Most gauges, monitoring and control devices nowadays have OPC servers that can be used to obtain the current data. OPC Scada Viewer supports the main and most widely used OPC DA1 and DA2 standards that allow you to exchange data with programmable logic controllers, human-machine interfaces, computer numerical controlled devices and other devices in real time.

OPC Scada Viewer allows you to easily and very visually display data received via the OPC interface. Data is displayed in real time, which allows you to use the program for permanent control and monitoring in various systems. OPC Scada Viewer offers a lot of indicators for displaying the values of OPC tags, from simple analog pointer indicators to charts and diagrams. It is possible to customize every indicator separately for your needs.
