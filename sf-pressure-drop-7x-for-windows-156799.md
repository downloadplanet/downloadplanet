# SF Pressure Drop 7.x for Windows
Description
SF Pressure Drop for Windows calculates pressure drops of flowing liquids and gases in pipes laminar and turbulent flow Its also possible to calculate pressure changes caused by vertical difference of pipe and caused by changes of kinetic energy dynamic pressure change
SF Pressure Drop calculates also pressure drops in pipe elements example changes of direction and in diverse fittings valves bellows etc A list of the calculable elements see below
Its possible to combine diverse elements and so you will get total pressure drop
To calculate pressure drop you need data of pipes rougness and data of flow medium density viscosity These data are available in several databases An additional possibility to save your own data is the userdefined database
Further features

Database of properties of liquids and gases and property calculation density viscosity
Calculation of properties of water and steam according Industry Standard IAPWSIF all conditions within the range to °C and to bar are calculable
Properties dry and humid air and air in saturation state
Properties of CO in the range K to K and to bar
Properties of miscellaneous liquids and gases Besides the properties which are available as measured values you can estimate properties of more than gases and liquids at different temperature and pressure You can also estimate mixtures
Estimation of refrigerants at different temperature and pressure
Estimation of aqueous solutions
Estimation of heat trensfer oils
