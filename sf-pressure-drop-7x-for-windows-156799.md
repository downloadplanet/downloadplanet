# SF Pressure Drop 7.x for Windows<br />Description
SF Pressure Drop 7. for Windows calculates pressure drops of flowing liquids and gases in pipes (laminar and turbulent flow). It's also possible to calculate pressure changes caused by vertical difference of pipe and caused by changes of kinetic energy (dynamic pressure change).
SF Pressure Drop calculates also pressure drops in pipe elements (example: changes of direction) and in diverse fittings (valves, bellows etc.). A list of the calculable elements see below.
It's possible to combine diverse elements and so you will get total pressure drop.
To calculate pressure drop you need data of pipes (rougness) and data of flow medium (density, viscosity). These data are available in several databases. An additional possibility to save your own data is the user-defined database.
