# MITCalc Epicyclic gear design<br />The calculation is designed for geometric and strength design and check of epicyclic gearing with straight and helical toothing. The application provides solutions for the following tasks.
- Calculation of helical and straight toothing.
- Automatic design of a transmission with the minimum number of input requirements.
- Design for entered coefficients of safety.
- Calculation of complete geometric parameters (including corrected toothing).
- Optimization of toothing by use of proper correction (balancing specific slips, minimizing specific slips, strength...).
- Calculation of strength parameters, safety check.
- Supplementary calculations (calculation of parameters of the existing gear, design of shafts, check dimensions).
- Support of 2D CAD (AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, IntelliCAD, Ashlar Graphite, TurboCAD) and 3D CAD in full calculation package (Autodesk Inventor, SolidWorks)
- Drawings of an accurate tooth shape including data (X,Y coordinates).
The calculations use procedures, algorithms and data from standards ANSI, ISO, DIN, BS and specialized literature.
List of standards: ISO 6336, ISO 1328, DIN 867, DIN 3960, DIN 3990, ISO 6336-5 and others.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300272981&affiliateid=200057808)
