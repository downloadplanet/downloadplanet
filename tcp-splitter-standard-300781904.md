# TCP Splitter Standard
TCP Splitter - is a software tool that can split a TCP or UDP data stream into two or three identical data streams, so more than one application can simultaneously process the incoming data. For example, you can send NMEA 0183 data to a navigation application and simultaneously log the data using one of our loggers. You can use TCP Splitter to build distributed monitoring systems where data is duplicated.
