Polygon Cruncher reduces the number of polygons of your objects without changing their appearance. You keep all details even at high optimization ratio. You also keep texture information, vertex colors, user defined normals. You protect object borders, material boundaries, UVs seams... You can optimized taking care of the symetry of your objects. Polygon Cruncher for Lightwave includes 2 different modules: An plugin that includes a built in OpenGL view and allows to optimize the content of one or several Lightwave layer. It gives a precise control on the way optimization is performed. The utility plugin includes batch process module for your Lightwave files and generates different LODs for your 3D assets. It is also a way to import files from various 3D file format into Lightwave. An external application for optimizing your 3D assets that come from various file formats (sketchup, wavefront, stl, maya...). This module also includes batch processing. Polygon Cruncher uses an exceptional algorithm developed since 10 years, which gives incomparable results, really better than what you can get with optimizer provided with 3DS Max or Lightwave. Polygon Cruncher is really simple to use. It has been chosen by major 3D companies: Autodesk, Anark, Activision, Epic Games, Airbus, Boeing, Sega, Sony, 3DO, Digital Domain, Kalisto...
