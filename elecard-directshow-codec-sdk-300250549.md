# Elecard DirectShow Codec SDK
Elecard DirectShow Codec SDK is a software development kit intended to enable programmers to develop digital video encoding, multiplexing and playback applications (encoders, players, transcoders, streamers) using Elecard components within the Microsoft DirectShow technology.
Elecard DirectShow Codec SDK supports Intel® Quick Sync video technology and allows speed up the process of video encoding, processing, conversion and playback due to Intel® Quick Sync hardware acceleration.

Base Classes - a C++ class library that simplifies common tasks,appearing during development of multimedia applications, such as: DirectShow graphs building, filters and pins control etc. Base classes are used in SDK sample applications and are delivered in source form.
Samples are simple applications that demonstrate Elecard components and Base Classes use. The samples are written in C++.
The registered SDK comprises:
a set of filters with codecs in demo mode (no functional and time limits, only logo);
source codes of sample applications;
full technical documentation (filters' interfaces, header files);
