# ASN.1 C Compiler
ASN.1 C Compiler can automatically translate ASN.1 specifications into C data structures plus metadata for encoding and decoding ASN.1 messages using one of the encoding rules (BER, CER, DER, PER). Developers can easily integrate these codes into their applications. In addition to the ASN.1 C Compiler, ASN.1 C Runtime Library is also part of the package. The ASN.1 C Runtime Library is delivered as a set of low-level primitive C routines for encoding and decoding the base ASN.1 types (BOOLEAN, INTEGER, etc.) and a rich collection of utility functions to operate on application messages. The ASN.1 C Runtime Library is ANSI C compliant, so that it can run on a wide-variety of platforms and processors from mainframes to embedded systems.
