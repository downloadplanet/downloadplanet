# TimePanic<br />![TimePanic](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P162550/BIG/162550.JPG)<br />TimePanic is a tool for personal time tracking at computer-based workplaces. At the simplest level, TimePanic can replace your notepad that you use to write down when you arrive in the morning and when you leave in the evening. Even for this very basic form of time tracking, TimePanic is the better solution because it can be configured to track the start and end time of your working day without a single mouse click.
TimePanic really has a lot more to offer. If you want to keep a protocol of your daily work and to break it down into individual jobs so that they can be easily summarized in reports (e.g. when a project is over), then you will find TimePanic to be a well thought-out scheme for categorizing jobs by work type, project and teamwork. In order to calculate overtime, TimePanic lets you specify planned working hours and public holidays and allows you to record annual leave, sick leave and flexitime. A wizard assists you with the creation of reports.
The user interface has been designed to make logging your jobs a very simple task. Basically, a single mouse click on a configured button suffices to finish your current job and to start a new one. You may even choose to use TimePanic as your electronic diary and to add comments to your jobs so as to maintain a detailed project history.
TimePanic has been built for personal time tracking. It can help individuals to understand their working days and may uncover surprising patterns and trends. Only he who observes himself can improve his style of working. TimePanic is available in English, in German and in French.
