CyberSky can display and print attractive, highly-customizable maps of the sky as seen from your home, your favorite vacation spot, or any other location on the Earth. The program’s clean, user-friendly interface makes it easy to identify the objects you see in the sky and find the objects you want to see.

CyberSky has a versatile animation feature that lets you watch astronomical events unfold at whatever pace you desire. This feature is not only a lot of fun, it makes the program very well-suited for astronomy education. Many of the most basic and interesting astronomical phenomena can only be seen over weeks, months, or even years, or by observing the sky from widely separated locations on the Earth. CyberSky lets you do this—it places the sky under your control.

CyberSky is used by people all over the world who want to become familiar with the objects they see in the sky, by amateur and professional astronomers who need a straightforward, uncluttered planetarium program, by parents who want to share their interest in astronomy with their children, and by educators who want to empower their students to learn in a way unimagined a generation ago. CyberSky has something to offer you, regardless of your level of astronomy knowledge.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300121558&affiliateid=200057808)
