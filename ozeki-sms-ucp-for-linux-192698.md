# OZEKI SMS UCP for Linux
This application can be used to send and receive SMS messages. The software uses the UCP/Emi2 or CIMD2 or ColourSMS protocol to communicate with the SMS Service Center (SMSC) of the GSM provider. The incoming messages are stored by the application in a database (e.g.: MySql,PostgresSql, Sybase,etc...) table. If we would like to send an SMS all we have to do is create a record in another database table.
