If you can sketch and paint you can use Curvy as a simple introduction to 3D modelling software.

Drawing is Fast: Curvy brings new speed to 3D modelling by letting you draw shapes straight into 3D. Create whole models with just a few strokes. Sculpting 3D models for art and games is quick and hassle free.

Sculpting is Fun: Curvy brings new Adaptive Subdivision to its sculpting toolset so you can sculpt freely and forget about the underlying mesh.

Painting is Easy: Colours and shapes are easy to work with using Curvy's artist friendly tools. You can sketch and paint colours, forms and bumps directly onto your 3D models, and then export models and textures for use in other 3D software.

3.0 comes with new Weld and Voxel merge technologies plus over 100 shaded material lightmaps.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300602656&affiliateid=200057808)
