# ZylIdleTimer (Delphi/C++Builder) - Single Developer License
ZylIdleTimer is a Delphi / C++Builder component which helps you to take actions after a specified system-wide (related to the whole system) or application (related only to the application) idle time or to check the time interval of user inactivity. System Idle time is the time interval of full user inactivity. In this interval any user action is missing on the computer, like pressing a key of the keyboard or moving the mouse or pressing a mouse button or rotating the scroll. Application Idle time is the time interval of user inactivity inside of one application. In this interval the user doesn't press a key of the keyboard or a mouse button inside of one window of the application.
