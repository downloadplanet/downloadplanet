# AutoDateTime
OfficeOne AutoDateTime extends PowerPoint to allow you to insert the current date and time and it keeps the inserted date/time up-to-date with the current system date/time. Here is a list of features that AutoDateTime introduces:
Customize the date and time display in a variety of formats.
  Configure AutoDateTime to show the time elapsed from the start of the show.
  Supports scripting to allow you to display result of any expression. This is very useful when you want to display a countdown towards a particular event or a count-up from a date.
AutoDateTime works with Microsoft PowerPoint 2010, Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007 SP2, Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003, Microsoft PowerPoint 2002 (XP) and Microsoft PowerPoint 2000. Download and install AutoDateTime - it will automatically register with your PowerPoint environment. You can access AutoDateTime on the Insert tab (PowerPoint 2007 and later versions) or the AutoDateTime menu item in the Format menu (PowerPoint 2003 and earlier versions).
