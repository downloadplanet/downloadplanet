Auto Backup for MySQL Professional Edition is a powerful Windows program that makes it easy to schedule the backing up and restoring of your remote and local MySQL databases. It's easy to back up one or many databases, and restore them to the same server, or to any server.

Auto Backup for MySQL Professional Edition uses reliable TCP/IP protocol to back up and restore your MySQL databases. It's easy to back up MySQL databases, tables and views to SQL or PHP files. And it's easy to export MySQL tables and views to comma-delimited, XML, HTML, and text files.

Auto Backup for MySQL Professional Edition works as a stand-alone utility, and does not require any additional software. It's not necessary to have MySQL installed on your local computer to perform backups or restores.

The program's wizards make it easy to back up and restore your databases. Simply specify the SQL/PHP/GZIP file names and locations, and set up a schedule. Auto Backup for MySQL Professional Edition will automatically perform the backup and restore work unattended. You can also run the program manually, any time you'd like. You can even run Auto Backup for MySQL as a Windows Service. This way, you do not need to log in Windows for backup and restore.

Auto Backup for MySQL Professional Edition can back up MySQL databases to the other server or to the other database; you can schedule the backing up of one or many MySQL databases from a remote or local server to the other remote or local server via TCP/IP protocol, using the same or different database names. In addition, the program can back up all newly-created databases and tables on the MySQL server, automatically.

All MySQL character sets are supported, including UTF8, UCS2, LATIN1 and more. The program supports all store engines and table types, including InnoDB, MyISAM, BDB and more. All MySQL field types are supported, including BOLB, TEXT, DECIMAL and more. The software can even back up records that contain image fields.

The program includes all of the advanced features that you'd expect in a professional backup program: It can create new folder names using date/time information for storing the backup files every time. It can automatically delete older backup archives based upon dates or the number of backups that you wish to keep. Both compression protocol and SSL protocol are supported. You can limit the maximum size of each task log file.

More features in the program include compression of backup files, the ability to restore databases from SQL/GZIP files, high-speed backup and restore, speed improvements, the ability to run as a Windows Service, support for unlimited size databases (more than 4GB), and the ability to schedule database restores.
