# Active Table Editor - Site license (1 year maintenance and support contract)
Active Table Editor helps the users edit ANY table in ANY Database.

Letâ€™s imagine following situation you have accounting software package and would like to design some additional reports. You know the database structure pretty well and created some mapping tables for the reports. Now you need to give the end users ability to change the mapping tables, print and export the data. You may use Oracle SQL plus or MS SQL Server Management studio to do that but these tools far too complicated for the users.
This is where Active Table Editor may step in to give you a helping hand.

Active Table Editor allows the administrator to log in and design the look of the application for the end users. You can edit user menus, security settings, menu items and input forms. All this complexity is left behind the scene for the end users. Once logged in, the end users see and edit the data, which was defined by the administrator. There is also an opportunity to use command line and in this way bypass login screen.

The product works with all major commercial and open source databases.
