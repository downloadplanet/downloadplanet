# BasicAudio ( Visual C++ Edition ) Single License + Source Code<br />![BasicAudio ( Visual C++ Edition ) Single License + Source Code](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300237001/BIG/300237001.JPG)<br />BasicAudio is a set of Visual C++ components for easy audio processing. They allow audio capture and playback with zero lines of program code. AudioLab supports both the old fashion Wave Win32 API, Audio ACM, and DirectShow, and even allows if needed any mixture of them. The developer can choose to go with any of them, to use all, or can switch from the one to the other at any moment. The components hide the complexity of both approaches, and make them look almost identical from the users prospective.
