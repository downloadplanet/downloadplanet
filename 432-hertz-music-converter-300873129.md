# 432 Hertz Music Converter<br />![432 Hertz Music Converter](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300873129/BIG/300873129.JPG)<br />Standard 440 Hz tuning which is often used in western music can be seen as a random frequency selection. Indeed many classic concerts and philharmonic orchestras do not use 440 Hz but other frequencies which better fit the instrument's characteristics.
Listeners of 432 Hz music report that the music sounds better and feels more harmonic. There are also reports of positive effects of 432 Hz and 528 Hz music (see here for technical details and here for healing indications).
