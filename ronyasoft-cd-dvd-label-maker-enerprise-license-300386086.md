RonyaSoft CD DVD Label Maker is a software program to design and print nice CD and DVD labels and covers. The software will help you if you are going to organize your video and mp3 disc collections or to create DVDs with some memorable events, if you are bored with handwritten scribbles on your CD-Rs and DVD-Rs, if you are not a professional designer and just want to make CD covers and even if you need temporary paper sleeves to present burned CDs or DVDs to your friends. Just try!
With an intuitive user interface, creating labels and covers is quick and easy. The program contains pre-designed label templates, while the WYSIWYG editor allows you to completely control the design of the label you get. You just enter the disc title and its description, choose an image and type in the list of tracks or files if necessary. You can also add extra images, texts, or shapes. Then print the label using label stock and a standard printer or CD label printer. Stick the label on the disc with the help of a CD applicator.
RonyaSoft CD DVD Label Maker supports a wide range of the labels and covers. The software supports CD and DVD labels, CD case inserts, DVD covers, Blu-Ray covers and case inserts, paper CD sleeves and origami CD cases (folded paper CD cases). The custom size template wizard allows you to create covers for non-standard multi disc cases, Nintendo Wii covers, Playstation 3 covers, etc. This labeling software is compatible with Avery, PressIt, Neato labels and popular CD label printers. Donâ€™t wait, make fine labels and covers yourself!
