# Rob Papen SubBoomBass 2
SubBoomBass 2 is the successor of the legendary SubBoomBass! Its GUI (graphical user interface) has received a makeover for more comfortable control of all features. SubBoomBass 2 still has its analogue modelled waveforms on board, but the sound colour has been expanded with new spectrum waveforms, new creative ‘think out of the box’ high quality samples and introducing Karplus-Strong string synthesis! You will understand that these new features generate fresh and unheard-of sounds! But there is more… An X/Y screen, a new pattern mode for running 4 sequences, and just like in SubBoomBass 2 it has the easy to use Bank Manager with star feature, so that you can quickly find and go to your favourite sounds straight away. And yes, all the original SubBoomBass presets are on board! This instrument is great for any style of contemporary music… any music styles including video game music, film scores and anywhere you need a great bass and fresh sound!
