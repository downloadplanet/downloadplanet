# PDF Signature Signer<br />PDF Signature Signer is a software program to sign PDF documents using X.509 certificates. The supported signing identity is PKCS#12, which evolved from the PFX (Personal inFormation eXchange) standard and is used to exchange public and private objects in a single file. PKCS#12 usually stores a private key with the appropriate public key certificate. PKCS#12 is the only accepted X.509 certificate by PDF Signature Signer. PDF Signature Signer features bulk signing that enables you to sign multiple PDF files by selecting input and output directory, and it doesn't limit the number of PDF files to be signed. PDF Signature allows you to sign PDF documents without any need to purchase Adobe Acrobat, thus dramatically reducing the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership). The software supports hot folder signing, which means you can install the software on your file server and ask PDF Signature Signer to monitor the newly-uploaded PDF files in the folder of your surveillance and sign them on the fly. PDF Signature Signer helps deploy the digital signing capability across organizations and simplifies the process of signing large numbers of PDF documents with electronic signature to confirm the identity of the originator.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300253971&affiliateid=200057808)
