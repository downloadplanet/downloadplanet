# Upgrade to IP camera CCTV Calculator 3
CCTVCAD Calculator is a professional tool for calculating network bandwidth needed for IP cameras (video encoders) and disk space required for storing video archives.

  With CCTVCAD Calculator you can:
Calculate network traffic generated by digital (IP) cameras and video encoders for the proper design of network CCTV systems.
Calculate disk space required for storing video archives during a specified time.
Calculation can be carried out for cameras that generate up to 3 simultaneous video streams (Viewing, Recording, Alarm recording) with different resolution, compression, frame rate and recording time.
Calculation can be carried out for a single camera, all cameras in the project, as well as for isolated groups of cameras, that is useful to estimate the load of separate network segments or equipment. Filtering and sorting are possible in the Table.
It is possible to correct intermediate results of calculations (frame size, traffic) if you know more accurate experimental data.
Calculations are based on practical results of measuring traffic. The results are combined in the Calculation Patterns, which are editable text files. Special patterns can be created by skilled users or manufacturers (distributors) of CCTV equipment by practical measurements of traffic for certain equipment, scenes and compression algorithms. Different cameras in one project can be assigned different patterns. The patterns can include a list of supported camera models. If any model from the list is assigned to a camera in the table, then calculation for the camera performs according to the pattern. Thus the maximum possible calculation accuracy can be achieved. The patterns can contain results of traffic measurements for some averaged scene with correction factors for its complexity and activity, and the results of traffic measurement for real scenes.
CCTVCAD Calculator can work with different sets of input data, depending on their availability and required accuracy. Default values will be assigned to unused fields. Unused columns in the table can be hidden and excluded from the calculation. Created Table Views can be saved and restored when needed. Thus CCTVCAD Calculator can be a simple calculator for simplified calculation only one stream from cameras, and a complex calculator, which takes into account three independent streams, color, sound, scene features, compression algorithm and hardware in use.
Source list of cameras can be entered manually or imported from VideoCAD project file, from VideoCAD, installed on the same computer or copied from MS Excel table.
Table of results or its fragments can be printed or exported to the formats: *. txt, *. csv, *. htm, *. rtf, *. xls.
