Convert2MetaStock allows you to to create data in the MetaStockTM or CompuTracTM format from an ASCII historical end-of-day data source file. The ASCII file can practically be in any file format. You can define how your ASCII source is structured, for example: which columns have which fields (date, time, open, close, etc) · what is the column delimiter character · what is the date format In addition, you can define how your output is to be created, for example: · the ticker symbol and name · whether to add the data to an existing ¿master¿ file or create a new one Simply launch the Convert2MS.exe file and select an ASCII text file using the File > Open menu command or the toolbar button. This will load the first 100 lines of your file (as a reminder of what it looks like) and automatically launch a Conversion Settings dialog box. Adjust the settings and hit CONVERT - your new MetaStockTM format file-set will be created. Convert2Ms will also update the MetaStock chart (EOD version or Offline mode) automatically if you have the chart opened in the MetaStock program.
