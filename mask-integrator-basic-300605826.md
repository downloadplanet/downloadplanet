There are pros and cons to the various methods of cropping and extracting and there are some tricks you should have in mind while photographing. You certainly get the highest quality masks with Hensels Freemask or a similar system. This is where the Mask Integrator comes into play. With the standard Freemask system you are limited to the continuous shutter speed and your subjects or models must be as still as possible. With Freemask 1000 you can freeze even waving hair and isolate and crop them automatically with the Mask Isolator.
These are the resulting applications of the Mask Integrator:
Very quick masking of complex subjects or motifs when working with Freemask or a similar system
When you shoot certain motifs for a particular background you can scale and place them correctly and display them while you are shooting which helps you concentrate on the correct perspective, the lighting and the relation between foreground and background
If you have to shoot a lot of products in a batch the Mask Integrator can mask them during the shoot and place them before a white background
Very fast tuning of Freemask 1000
