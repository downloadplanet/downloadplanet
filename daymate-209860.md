This professionally developed and well designed application allows to create and schedule reminders that can pop up messages with optional sound effects; start applications or open documents; and shut down, reboot, or power down your system. In addition to alarms and reminders, DayMate can also perform some routing computing tasks like launching a website, checking your email, sending messages, synchronizing your system time, shutting down your PC at a specified time, and more.

DayMate allows you to view all your appointments in a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly overview and get a quick look at the appointments of a single day in any calendar view. In addition, you can display a stay-on-top clock, as well as have the program chime or speak the hour, half hour, and quarter hour by the human voice.

DayMate is incredibly simple to use. You should not have a problem creating single or reoccurring appointments, color-coding different items, setting up reminders, and so on. If you need to reschedule an appointment or change its duration, DayMate has a drag and drop feature that makes this task quite easy to accomplish.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=209860&affiliateid=200057808)
