The Adobe® Flash® Media Live Encoder software can capture live audio and video while streaming it in real-time to the Adobe® Flash® Media Server or the Adobe® Flash® Video Streaming Service. Additionally, you have the opportunity to write the streams into a file. Using the MainConcept AAC Encoder Plug-In, you can directly generate and stream Flash compliant F4V and FLV files that include both H.264/AVC video and AAC audio in Adobe’s encoding tool.

The demo version of MainConcept AAC Encoder Plug-In is fully functional. It only has an audio encoding limitation of 30 seconds, i.e. after 30 seconds the audio as well as the video encoding process is stopped.

The plug-in only works when the Adobe® Flash® Media Live Encoder 2.5 (FMLE) application is installed on your system (not included).
