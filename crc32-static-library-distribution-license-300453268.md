# CRC32 Static Library (Distribution License)
CRC32 Static Library for Microsoft VC++ was produced to make your CRC checking operations quick & easy to implement seamlessly without the need for an external DLL The algorithm of CRC32 is exactly the same as that internally used by PKZIP and WinZip; i.e. the CRCs calculated by PKZIP and CRC32 are identical. That’s another fine thing about CRC32 - it calculates compatible, widely used 32-bit checksums, not just any numbers. You can use the 'pkunzip.exe -vt filename.zip' command to see that PKZIP’s CRC-32 values of files stored inside the filename.zip are identical to that calculated by CRC32 for these files.
NOTE: This allows you to send unlimited amount copies of the software out with your own software as you require, by no means must this software be sold separately.
All Updates to 1.xx are free of charge.
