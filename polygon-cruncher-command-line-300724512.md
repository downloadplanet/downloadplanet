Polygon Cruncher reduces the number of polygons of your objects without changing their appearance. You keep all details even at high optimization ratio. You also keep texture information, vertex colors, user defined normals. You protect object borders, material boundaries, UVs seams... You can optimized taking care of the symetry of your objects. Polygon Cruncher Command Line includes 2 different modules: * Polygon Cruncher Command Line feature, which allows to integrate quickly optimization feature in your pipeline. The command line version supports most common 3D formats (FBX, Collada, Cinema 4D, Sketchup, Modo, Lightwave, Stereolithography...). It output LODs from the source file, with a full control on the optimization process through the command line. * Polygon Cruncher Stand Alone application for optimizing your 3D assets that come from various file formats (sketchup, wavefront, stl, lightwave...). This module also includes batch processing. Polygon Cruncher uses an exceptional algorithm developed since 10 years, which gives incomparable results, really better than what you can get with optimizer provided with 3DS Max or Lightwave. Polygon Cruncher is really simple to use. It has been chosen by major 3D companies: Autodesk, Anark, Activision, Epic Games, Airbus, Boeing, Sega, Sony, 3DO, Digital Domain, Kalisto...
