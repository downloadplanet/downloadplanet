# Registry TuneUp
Registry TuneUp is a tool to optimize your system registry - the most important part of windows. It finds and removes errors in your windows registry, reducing application crashes, and thus enhancing the performance and reducing sluggishness. It cleans all parts of your registry, yet it is the safest, using a built-in ignore list to prevent important entries from being listed. It allows undo, has expert/normal modes, and is very fast and powerful.
