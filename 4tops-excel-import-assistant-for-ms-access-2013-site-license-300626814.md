# 4TOPS Excel Import Assistant for MS Access 2013, Site license
4TOPS Excel Import Assistant is an Access add-in for importing excel into access in a controlled way. Instead of entering data one by one from a spreadsheet or another source that can be converted into a spreadsheet, the users simply need to import data, thus saving enormous amount of time and money on data entry clerks. The wizard is typically used in situations such as a new Access system where data needs to be moved from Excel to Access or for regularly importing files from outside sources or from another system. By linking Access to your ODBC compliant database (Oracle, SQL Server, etc.) you can just as easily use the wizard to transfer Excel data into that. Import multiple files or sheets in one go. If suppress messages is selected all rejected records are copied into a failed import file where the user can correct them to subsequently re-import.
