This book is the collection of miscellaneous articles and other pieces of work that we have done during our careers. The main aim is to share different experiences and knowledge, not just limited to ours but also many others with whom we interacted during our careers. The reason for sharing these experiences and knowledge is because we always believe it to be our moral obligation towards the domain which has given us so much over the years. As every human is different, so every experience, despite its outcome or magnitude, may have some learning aspect to it. The things we discuss here is not to prove something right or wrong, rather there are suggestions to initiate discussion on topics. The response and feedback as a result of the discussions always prove a source of learning and improvement and that is why we keep updating our content based on that feedback.
