# Site Visualizer Professional (Site License)<br />![Site Visualizer Professional (Site License)](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300613217/BIG/300613217.JPG)<br />Site Visualizer is a website crawler tool, that visualizes site structure and shows a website as a set of pages and their outbound and inbound links. The crawler gathers all SEO-related parameters of every URL within a site, such as:
Page title, meta tags, and their lengths in symbols.
In links, out links, and external out links number.
H1-H6 headings information and number of occurrences.
URL response code, link anchors and REL attributes, image ALT and TITLE text.
Google Pagerank value, etc.
The data can be presented in table form, as well as in visual sitemap form, report form, or XML sitemap.
Site Visualizer software intended for webmasters, SEO specialists, and for all who want to analyze own (or other's) websites, view it's link structure (including images, CSS and JS script links), check errors and duplicate content, etc. The program's core advantages over other site crawlers are:
Visual Sitemap - the program visualizes your site structure: automatically draws it as a set of pages and links, which can be saved to an image file. Example of visual sitemap is available here.
Custom Reports - if you haven't found some analytics you need among predefined reports - you can use SQL in order to write your own report (or, you can ask us to do it for you, if you're new to SQL).
Convenient division of all crawled URLs into pages and links allows you to view a website's pages, their metrics and content values (title, meta tags, lengths in symbols, word and link count, size, etc.) separate from it's outbound and inbound links and their parameters (content MIME type, response code, link anchor and type, etc.) All data can be exported to an MS Excel file.
Note: some features availability depends on version of the program - Lite, Standard, or Professional. Please refer to version comparison table.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300613217&affiliateid=200057808)
