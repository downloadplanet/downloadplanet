# Upgrade: VideoCAD Professional (max 70 cameras) to VideoCAD 11 Professional
VideoCAD allows to Choose the most suitable lenses heights and locations for camera installation to provide the required parameters of view areas for detection and identification of a person and license plate reading Calculate the horizontal projection of camera control areas including shadows from obstacles on the scene Display by separate colors and hatch styles different regions of spatial resolution and fieldofview size Calculate the horizontal projection sizes of viewing person detecting identifying and license plate reading areas to draw them on the location plan Calculate the image size on display of any object in camera view area in percentage of display size pixels TV lines and millimetres inches in case of Imperial format Calculate and model depth of field of each camera in project Choose visually a relative location of cameras using the graphics window with CAD interface Choose the best positions and calculate control areas of PTZ cameras Locate cameras and cables on the prepared layouts in bmp jpg emf wmf png gif tif AutoCAD dwg dxf formats To import dwg and dxf files the CAD Import module by CAD Soft Tools httpwwwcadsofttoolscom was used Obtain a drawing containing two projections of site layout with the camera images calculated view areas and cables and with coordinate grid and titles to be used in graphical path of the project as well Print the obtained drawing on one or several pages You can use prepared frames with standard titleBlock and logo Export the obtained drawing into any of the following formatsbmp jpg emf wmf png gif tif AutoCAD dxf R AutoCAD dxf R Obtain a text file with full description of all cameras in the project view areas and cables to be pasted into a project explanatory note or used as instruction for installation Get detailed adjustable table of all initial and calculated parameters of cameras in project Print the table or export it to txt csvrtf xls htm formats Construct three dimensional models of real scenes with the possibility of loading prepared D models a person a car etc You can add your own D models from ds max and Google Sketchup Model observed scene parameters illumination visibility limitations Model luminaires considering spectrum of radiation and spectral sensitivity of image sensors including discharge lamps with complex spectrum and infrared LED illuminators Model camera parameters spectral response number of pixels including megapixel cameras with resolution exceeds screen resolution resolution minimum illumination at known signalnoise ratio IRE and aperture maximum signalnoise ratio electronic shutter AGC BLC gamma daynight camerasframe rate interlace scan global shutter and rolling shutter Model lens parameters focal length aperture auto iris DC and Video Drive Model DVR parameters brightness contrast compression horizontal and vertical sharpness Obtain Image Model for each camera in the project based on models of scene and equipment This image can be printed and saved Model moving objects camera frame rate create animated images with moving D models Model blur and distortion of moving D models depending on camera parameters Maintain database of camera models assign different models for cameras in project compare models with each other Design operator interface using the Monitor window Create animated monitor models as html files with moving D models and separate frame rates of each camera Calculate the length and electric parameters of cables Spare the means and win tenders due to the reduction of cameras quantity in projects and increase of their efficiency Reduce time expended and boost design quality Cut down the amount of controversial situations with customers and accelerate their solution
