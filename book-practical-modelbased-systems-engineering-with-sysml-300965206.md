# Book Practical Model-based Systems Engineering with SysML
If you want to develop model-based systems, you need both knowledge of model-based development and a suitable modeling language such as SysML. In this book you will get to know both in a well-founded and practice-oriented way. Also and especially if you do not have a computer science education but an engineering education, it will help you to quickly apply the approach originating from computer science in practice for system development. The author, who has developed a model-based approach for his company and trained more than 250 of his colleagues in it, first explains the basics of model-based development and introduces the elements of SysML that are important for practice. Then he introduces you to the practical application. He shows how the necessary development and supporting processes are introduced and illustrates the whole thing with a comprehensive application example. All the methods and procedures you will find here have been tried and tested in practice for years. The appendix contains useful modeling rules, a classification of model-based development in SPICE and a helpful quick reference for system modeling.
