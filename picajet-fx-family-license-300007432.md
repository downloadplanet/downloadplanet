# PicaJet FX (Family License)
Organize, enhance, print, find and share your digital photos with this elegant, all-in-one, digital photo organizer. You can now enjoy the same simplicity of the traditional photo album with your digital pictures. PicaJet makes sharing photos easy with a one-click picture-sending feature. The handy editing options and dynamic zoom let you play around with your digital photos to get the perfect picture. Change as much as you like because the original image stays intact; the changes you make are applied at export. If you're looking for a photo of Grandpa at Christmas but can't remember much more about the picture, PicaJet can search for the photo by the date it was taken, by category, by rating, or by user-defined criteria. The product features a slide-show mode, creating perfect web-galleries, skin support, image copying with dynamic editing, metadata import/export, direct import from digital camera or scanner, and the printing of multiple photos. PicaJet supports an unlimited number of images and lets you resize your photos without a loss in quality.
