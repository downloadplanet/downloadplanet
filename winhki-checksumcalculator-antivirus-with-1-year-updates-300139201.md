# WinHKI Checksum-Calculator Anti-Virus (with 1 year updates)
The program is the whole complement to your virus scanner. The great advantage is, that WinHKI Anti-Virus checks the background of Windows whether there are suspicious modifications. It works completely on system check in this case. If there is a virus or worm, which have overlooked from your virus scanner or haven't recognized, WinHKI Anti-Virus will join in. It examines files, which nest in the system or files, which change their size suddenly. For that are mostly Win32-PE-viruses responsible. The program only requires 0,4 MB of place on the hard disk.
