The book deals with the most popular and probably the most monumental form of the Hung Gar Kung Fu style. This form, known as "The Tiger and the Crane", was created in the late 19th century by Lam Sai Wing's teacher, an unrivalled master of Kung Fu Wong Fei Hung. The Tiger's extremely tough, fierce and lightning-fast attack are balanced against and supplemented by the softer and smoother techniques of the Crane. The "tough" and the "soft" combine in a harmony. A lot of attention is given to real-life combat application of the Kung Fu techniques in question.
