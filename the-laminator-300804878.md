# The Laminator<br />![The Laminator](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300804878/BIG/300804878.PNG)<br />The Laminator is an engineering program written for Windows 7/8/10 that analyzes laminated composite plates according to classical laminated plate theory. Input consists of ply material properties, material strengths, ply fiber orientation and stacking sequence, mechanical loads and/or strains, and temperature and moisture loads. Output consists of apparent laminate material properties, ply stiffness and compliance matrices, laminate "ABD" matrices, laminate loads and mid-plane strains, ply stresses and strains in global and material axes, and load factors for ply failure based on Maximum Stress, Maximum Strain, Tsai-Hill, Hoffman, and Tsai-Wu failure theories. A micromechanics calculator is also included for estimating lamina properties for given fiber and matrix properties. The program can also be run from the command line for batch processing.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300804878&affiliateid=200057808)
