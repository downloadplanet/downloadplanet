PACE Suite is an advanced software packaging tool with intuitive user interface and set of features providing (re)packaging in Windows Installer and various virtualization formats. 


PACE Suite consists out of three components:
MSI Generator – enables capturing legacy setup of any format into a project, applying corporate packaging standards and generating customized packages of different formats – App-V 5, MSI, MST and ThinApp.
MSI Editor – the tool for extensive editing of Windows Installer packages. Perfect for both advanced packagers and newbies because it greatly combines a simple UI and advanced editing capabilities.
Docu Generator – the handy tool allowing creating screenshot-based instructions like discovery documents.
Every package created with PACE Suite is:
Well-structured and ICE error-free – Correct component and feature assignment, no ICE errors in a repackaged MSI. Table identifiers are human-readable, which makes editing easy.
Contains no tool-related extraneous staff – PACE Suite does not create any redundant MSI tables, properties, or custom actions.
High-quality MSI. PACE Suite follows all application packaging best practices and rules.
