# 3D Geometrical Objects<br />The software is designed as a simple accessory for teaching math. The program can represent the following objects in 3D space: - regular prism (3 to 10 sides) - general three-sided prism - special four-sided prism (adjustable inclination of sides) - regular pyramid (3 to 10 sides) For each geometrical object, certain parameters can be interactively adjusted, such as: height and length of sides, inclination of sides, number of sides, etc. Each object can be gradually and smoothly opened or closed from its basic net to a geometrical object. Each adjustment of parameters is interactive and seen immediately - animated. Each object can be freely rotated in 3D space at 'all times of the process'. Additionally, each object can be zoomed-in, or zoomed-out, at any scale. 3D animation executes at high speed - in real time, even on slower machines.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=133861&affiliateid=200057808)
