# PDF Imposition DE<br />PDF Imposition DE software automates the process of 2up'ing or 4up'ing a pdf document, so for example with a/b 2up page 1 is on the left and page 2 is on the right, with split 2up (4 page document) page 1 is on the left and page 3 is on the right, then page 2 is on the next page left and page 4 is on the right. It has an optional -down parameter for 2up'ing downwards on a page rather than across the page (left, right)
The output page size can also be controlled and the 2nd page position can be offset with margin controls.
Optional -duplicate option for duplicating pages so you get the same page 1,1 left and right output.
NOTE: This is standalone i.e. Adobe Acrobat is NOT required.
All future updates to v1.xx version are free of charge.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300449895&affiliateid=200057808)
