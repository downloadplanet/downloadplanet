# Layer2 Business Data List Connector for SharePoint
The fast, easy and complete integration of external LOB data, e.g. from databases, is a common equirement in the use of Microsoft SharePoint technology. Existing solutions, such as the Business Data Catalog (BDC) in SharePoint 2007 or the Business Catalog Service (BCS) in SharePoint 2010/2013/2016/2019, are often too complex at the facility, bring with them limitations and they are are available for specific editions only.
The SharePoint Business Data List Connector (BDLC) on the other hand, connects native SharePoint lists (no Web Parts) to 100+ external business data sources , using a very simple list settings dialogue.

It can be configured easily with 3 simple settings only regarding data Provider, connection string, data query and primary key(s).
The desired data can be presented without any restrictions, with the full read-only and write-back (CRUD) functionality of common SharePoint lists made available: views, sorting and grouping, filters, calculated fields can be created as usual.
Workflows and notifications per RSS or email can be used to take business actions directly in SharePoint, if external business data records are changed.
