Actual Window Minimizer lets you minimize any application to a small icon in the System Tray or to any Screen Edge.
This feature helps save the taskbar and desktop space and use them in a more efficient manner.
Actual Window Minimizer is an ideal solution for programs such as e-mail clients (Outlook Express, Outlook, Eudora etc.), audio players (Windows Media Player, CD Player etc.), offline-browsers and ftp-clients, or any background processing programs.
To minimize a window to System Tray or to a Screen Edge, simply click the minimize button in the window title bar as usual.
You need to configure the program only once: Actual Window Minimizer will remember all your settings and apply them on next startup. So, you can set up any application just once and this program will always be minimized to tray or any screen edge by your choice. But, of course, you can change these settings any time you want.
Actual Window Minimizer now has multilingual support. It supports English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian and others!
