Mr. Newton and Mr. Gauss were engaged in-depth with numerical solutions for these problems. Today, there are improved algorithms, that can solve such tasks.
InterReg allows you to do such complex calculations just with some point-and-click. So this program is not only for mathematics and engineers. The applications are many and reach from education over science to productive use in your company: in example a meaningful sales forecast can be done in minutes.
Over this, the software offers some other functionality to do curve sketching, integration and statistics as well.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300172844&affiliateid=200057808)
