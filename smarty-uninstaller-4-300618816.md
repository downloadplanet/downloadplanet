Smarty Uninstaller is a software that allows you to completely uninstall programs (64 and 32-bit) installed on your system. It monitors the built-in application uninstaller and uses an advanced scan engine that deletes any program leftovers. It allows you to launch the scan engine manually at any time to force uninstall a program with broken uninstaller. Featuring an intuitive and modern interface, Smarty Uninstaller displays in the main window all installed software, broken installations, system components and Windows updates. The grouping feature allows you to organize applications into logical groups and view grouped programs in separate tabs. You can add comments to installed applications which will be displayed on the main window when an application is selected. In addition to the smart scan engine, Smarty Uninstaller provides you with an easy to use but effective feature – Smarty Snapshot. It allows you to monitor the installation of new applications and detect every change made to your system during this process. These changes are saved to the snapshot, that can be accessed later at any time for review or complete uninstall. Smarty Uninstaller has been developed and fully tested to work great on Windows® 8 and other Windows® operating systems, from Windows® XP and up. No matter what you own - a PC or a laptop or netbook or tablet.
