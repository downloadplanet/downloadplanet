The founder of the style is considered Tie Zhu, one of several monks who survived complete devastation of the Southern Shaolin monastery by emperor Yongzheng’s troops. After long wandering Tie Zhu settled down in the village of Jindouyang. The village was situated in a remote mountain region in the North-East of the Fujian province where since long time the small nationality SHE lived. In time Tie Zhu opened a school to teach local inhabitants. Later the style was spread among the people of SHE and received the present name. SHE, one of small peoples in South-East China, inhabit mountain region at the junction of provinces Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong. During long time the SHE people led isolated life. Contacts of SHEs with the outside world were limited very much until the middle of the 20th century. SHE ZU QUAN, always being a closed style, was passed down from generation to generation at family schools. The people of SHE used SHE ZU QUAN for protection of their homes and crops, they shared secrets of the mastery very seldom and hid them from strangers.
