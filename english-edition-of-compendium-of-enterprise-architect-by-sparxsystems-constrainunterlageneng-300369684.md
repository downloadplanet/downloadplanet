# English Edition of Compendium of Enterprise Architect by SparxSystems "CONSTRAINUNTERLAGENENG"<br />This edition has been revised and adapted to EA version 15. Most of the functions described can also be used with older EA versions. The menu items may be in a different position or have a different name. In our blog (blog.sparxsystems.de) you will find articles with further information on translation tables between the different EA versions. With this edition we have restructured and redesigned the book. Three main focus areas are distinguished: EA specific topics, modelling languages and methods. In order to do justice to the title "Compendium", the individual topics are described as independent information units in order to present the information to the interested reader in a concise and concise manner. The structure of the individual chapters is designed so that a serial reading of all chapters as well as a targeted reading of individual chapters is possible. References to other chapters help to read up on missing knowledge.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300369684&affiliateid=200057808)
