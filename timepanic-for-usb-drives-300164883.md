It tracks your hours on a per project basis, distinguishes between billable and non-billable tasks, lets you enter comments, manages your absences, calculates overtime and prints reports.
TimePanic for USB drives is portable. It does not need to be installed and does not use the Windows registry or your hard drives.
Unlike most other time tracking software, TimePanic is particularly good at tracking your hours in real time, as opposed to writing them down from memory at the end of the day or the week. With only two mouse clicks, you can track each relevant task switch in TimePanic at the very moment it happens. This saves you from the hassle of manual time entry, and along the way, your timesheets will become so accurate that your customers will not even think of questioning them.
There are two features in TimePanic that support the two click task switch: First, the favorite activities feature lets you preconfigure your most frequently used tasks, and second, TimePanic can be set to run as a permanently visible icon in the notification area of the Windows task bar.
A number of functions in TimePanic have been realized by means of the report feature. Besides printing, they include searching and exporting data. Reports are saved in a standard document format for further processing and printing by third-party applications should the need arise. Exported time tracking data can be easily imported into Microsoft Excel.
To keep you from having to re-create frequently needed reports every week or every month, favorite reports can be preconfigured in much the same way as favorite activities. For example, you can create a monthly report and set it to always use the data of the previous month. Every time a new month begins, you can reuse this report with a simple mouse click to obtain a summary of the last month.
TimePanic is available in English, German and French.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300164883&affiliateid=200057808)
