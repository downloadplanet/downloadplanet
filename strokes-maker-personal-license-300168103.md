It allows to create analogues of etchings and engravings in a semi-automatic mode. The artist has tools at his disposal of automatic filling of shaped areas, and of manual drawing to a line of a stroke with the subsequent automatic calculation of strokes. The light version of the program includes basic tools which can be quite enough for creation of complex black-and-white and color shaped images.
