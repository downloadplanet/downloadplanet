# Miraplacid Data Viewer
Miraplacid Data Viewer is a tool for convenient binary file internals analysis. It represents binary file structure as a tree. Viewer highlighted selected tree item in the hex viewer panel. A byte selected in a hex viewer can be looked up in the tree. Viewer has rich search and navigation functionality, and can save selected chunk of data to a file. How it works: of course, it cannot be done without knowing the binary file format. Both Miraplacid Binary DOM and Miraplacid Data Viewer rely on Miraplacid Binary Data Definition (.bdd) files, which contain definitions for internal binary file structure. All the .bdd files included into the Miraplacid software package, as well as all the .bdd files posted on a community web site http://BinoPedia.org are licensed under Creative Commons Share Alike CC BY-SA 3.0. This license permits you to modify .bdd files and use them in commercial products. If you need to use this binary data manipulation technology in your own software, this is possible with Miraplacid Binary and Text DOM SDK, which provides .Net 2.0 - compatible library (BinaryDOM.dll), PowerShell snapin to work with files as drives, documentation and examples. Platform: Microsoft Dotnet 4.0.
