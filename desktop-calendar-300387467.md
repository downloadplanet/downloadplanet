Why is Desktop Calendar different from any other task planner for Windows?
There are two conceptions which differ Desktop Calendar from the standard task planner:
Desktop Calendar can remind you even few months earlier about your task. In such a way you are able to quit every long-term contract (i.e. contract cellular phone) right on time.
There is no need to input annoying task duration or time of day for the task - who cares, at what time to congratulate grandma on her birthday? How long does the congratulation last? It makes Desktop Calendar simple.
However defining the time of day is optionally possible for each task. Desktop Calendar can notify you even before your today's task should occur (in the range of one minute to few hours). In such a way you don’t miss your favorite TV-program and you don’t bid too late on eBay.
