Observe all the hectic goings-on at a normal bus stop: Willi S. drives past on his way to work just as he does every day. Therese Weinlaub is on the telephone again to an acquaintance. Grandad Heinrich is settling down on the bench. Edda Weinstein is riding back to her little farm, and Heiner Nassir has got a cold as usual. Road sweeper Izmir Ãœ. Bell is making sure that the pavement is kept clean, while Berni Bocker shoots past on his skateboard. Ottilie Blabber is taking her dog for a walk and Gundula Kiesel is complaining about everything again.
