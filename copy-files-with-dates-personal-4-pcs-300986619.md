Copy Files With Dates is a program for Windows™ to copy files while keeping the original creation date, modification date and the original attributes of the files and directories. The program quickly and easily solves the fundamental problem that Windows™ sets the date of copying as the new creation date of files and folders when copying files between different drives and devices, and the original creation date of files and directories is lost.
