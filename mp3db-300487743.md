This program scans your harddrives or CD-ROMs for audio files and reads the embeded meta information (title, artist, album, etc.) into a database. With the search capabilities of a database program you can find a title in seconds and enqueue or play it or launch your preferred audio player application, e.g. WinAmp. This software is fun when you already have collected a large number of MP3 files.
