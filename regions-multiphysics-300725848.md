# REGIONS Multi-Physics<br />![REGIONS Multi-Physics](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300725848/BIG/300725848.JPG)<br />REGIONS Multi-Physics (REGIONS X) – is software for solving boundary value problems of mathematical physics. The program is based on unique analytical method – Fictitious Canonic Region Method (FCRM). FCRM is a Treftz kind method of solving boundary values problems, so it allows estimating easily the error of the solution and get robust results. The REGIONS X program has unique, totally analytical parametric geometry modeler. All geometry can be created as a set of analytical parametric equations. This feature allows modeling geometry objects with zero error precision. The geometry parameters can be changed easily at any moment of problem solution. Changing geometry allows researchers investigate the solution behavior depending on the geometric parameters (example – stress concentration depending on the rounding radius).<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300725848&affiliateid=200057808)
