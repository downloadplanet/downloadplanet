# Filtered Noise Generator<br />![Filtered Noise Generator](https://mycommerce.akamaized.net/api/pimages/P300227143/BIG/300227143.PNG)<br />The Filtered Noise Generator can generate noise signals and apply different frequency filters on them in real time. Practical applications of filtered noise are for example: · Loudspeaker testing: When testing a loudspeaker, only the frequencies of the usable bandwidth should be applied. E.g., when testing a tweeter, you need a high passed signal. · Tinnitus masking: Tinnitus appears usually in a very limited frequency band. With a band pass filter you can focus a masking signal onto this band. · Cross-over simulation for speaker system development: Use a low pass filter on one channel and a high pass on the other. Then connect a woofer and tweeter to each, and you can simulate different cross-over frequencies and their effects with ease. Signals created can be saved as a .WAV file in order to make an audio CD. You can run scripts of noise signals and save memory pre-sets of noise parameters to disk. The program supports multiple sound cards.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300227143&affiliateid=200057808)
