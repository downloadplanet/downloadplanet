They allow audio capture, processing and playback with zero lines of program code.
AudioLab supports Wave Win32 API, Audio ACM, DirectX Media Objects (DMO), DirectShow, ASIO, VST 2.X, VST 3.0 and allows if needed any mixture of them. The developer can choose to go with any of them, to use all, or can switch from the one to the other at any moment. The components hide the complexity of both approaches, and make them look almost identical from the users prospective.
The library is fully multithreaded, utilizes well modern multi-core systems, and runs at full native performance.
Also includes a Visual Graphical Editor for Codeless Development.
Contains:
Audio Capture components - captures audio from microphone, LineIn, Modem or other input device (DirectShow, WaveAPI and ASIO)
Audio Recording components - records in Wave, WMA(ASF), Ogg, and other formats (DirectShow, WaveAPI, Ogg and Windows Media Encoder).
Audio Playback components - plays Wave, WMA(ASF), Ogg, and other file formats (DirectShow, WaveAPI, Ogg and Windows Media Encoder).
Audio Output components - plays audio aver speakers, LineOut, Modem or other Output device (DirectShow, WaveAPI and ASIO)
Audio Broadcast - broadcasts audio over IP using Windows Media Encoder.
Audio Receiver - receives remote audio over IP using Windows Media Encoder.
Audio Generators - generate Wave, Triangle, Rectangle, ChainSaw, Random Gauss and custom audio.
Audio Processing - audio filters, amplifiers, equalizers and converters, including custom user defined filters(DirectShow, DMO, and native).
VST 2.X Component - allows usage of VST 2.X Plug-ins
VST 3.0 Component - allows usage of Plug-ins
Audio Mixer - Mixes audio signals.
Audio Switches - control enable and disable the audio flow.
