The software uses original algorithms for calculation of vector strokes based on initial raster images. It renders halftones and image relief. Thousands of strokes interrupt and intersect under different angles, turn from continuous to dotted line, disappear and emerge again, changing their path and forming a unique of a kind high quality vector image. One incorrectly calculated stroke, like one false note in a symphony, can spoil the harmony of lines making up a single image. But the Strokes Maker is tool of exclusively fine tuning, and if it is necessary to disrupt the mathematical precision of lines the intuitive friendly parameters will help to give a handworked reality.

To obtain such line-art images (engravings) before now â€“ days, weeks, sometimes even months of meticulous handmade work performed by engraving craftsmen were required. It is sufficient to download now a demo version of the software and you can try it. However, as any sophisticated tool the Strokes Maker allows a significant creative freedom. It is possible to hatch a photograph with a simple hatching from the standard set, and it is also possible to spend the whole day creating a portray, which consists of dozens, and sometimes even hundreds of various forms, masks and hatchings.
