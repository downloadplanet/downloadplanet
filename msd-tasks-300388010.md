Work orders can be printed and presented to the clients. ▪ Includes a statistics module which allows to know in detail how task dates are met by every work team. ▪ Different states can be associated to tasks in order to control their fulfillment (pending, initiated, finished, suspended and cancelled). ▪ Tasks can be associated to Projects and Clients. This information can be used to easily find the tasks that belong to a project or to a certain client. ▪ All program reports can be saved to disk in PDF format. ▪ These are some examples of the activities that can be managed with this program: ▪ A secretary could manage the agenda of one or more managers, controlling their visits, meetings, reports, appointments, travels, etc. ▪ A manager could control the tasks and activities of his employees. The program provides stored tasks to easily manage recurrent activities. ▪ A services company could manage the tasks of its employees, with the possibility of classifying them by project and of assigning them to a certain client. ▪ A professional could manage his clients visits and meetings, assigning times and dates very easily thanks to the visual interface of the planners.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300388010&affiliateid=200057808)
