# Cute PDF/RTF Converter Small Business License (10 Domains)
A small business license allows use of the Software for all users at 10 sites within a single company. The license key will be generated based on your site domain names. If you will be using the components in an intranet environment, the license key will be generated based on server names. You may also install and use the Software on an unlimited number of developer workstations (but not on a development server) for use in connection with the same single website host name when accessed by the http://localhost/Webapplication; A big benefit of the small business license is you can add additional sites to your license file at any time if you don't have 10 sites right now.
