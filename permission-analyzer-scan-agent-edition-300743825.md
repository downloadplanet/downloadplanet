# Permission Analyzer Scan Agent Edition
Permission Analyzer scans your network and combines NTFS permissions with user and group data from the Active Directory. All data that is stored locally can be retrieved to create overviews of permissions per group or user. You will be able to monitor permissions for entire user groups and receive notifications if undesired permissions are flagged within your network.
Main features
Scanning the network
Configure the directories and LDAP Organizational Units to scan. All directory information and group memberships from LDAP are saved in a local database file. Run the scan whenever you like or schedule an automated scan. Permission Analyzer supports an external database, allowing multiple workstations to share the same information source.
Running your overviews
All information is saved on a database, allowing you to conduct targeted search queries in seconds, instead of scanning the whole network every time you want to apply a new filter. Add filters for specific members, all members of a group or LDAP OU, permissions or folders.
Tracing permissions
The main overview provides an aggregated summary of all permissions found and may contain the permissions of multiple users or groups. The Trace function is part of the overview and shows you the origin of permissions for a specific user or group and folder (via the group membership or parent folder they have been inherited). Use this view to zoom in on your search results.
