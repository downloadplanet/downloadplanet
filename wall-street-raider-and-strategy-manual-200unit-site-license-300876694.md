# Wall Street Raider and Strategy Manual (200-unit Site License)
Wall Street Raider is a live action Wall Street high finance simulation. Wall Street Raider lets you invest in, or take control of, any of up to 1590 companies in 71 industries, using all the tools and tricks of real corporate raiders: Greenmail, LBOs, tender offers, IPOs, junk bond financing, mergers, liquidations, and all types of financial shenanigans are all available. Actively trade stocks and bonds as a passive investor and/or take over and manage companies like IBM, Microsoft, Dow Chemical, British Telecom, Siemens, KLM, etc., as you build your corporate empire to dominate whole industries. Players and companies can also trade and speculate in put and call stock options; interest rate swap derivatives; Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies; and commodities (gold, silver, crude oil, wheat and corn); and trade futures on all of the commodities, cryptocurrencies and on the Global Stock Index. You start off rich, with up to $1 billion, and seek to take over and grow your companies into a large empire, sometimes with hundreds if subsidiaries, if you are successful enough.
This is a Site License downloadable version, with a 5-year license term, authorizing reproduction and/or distribution of up to 200 copies of the setup file, used by universities in finance classes, business schools, and Mergers & Acquisitions classes in law schools throughout North America, including universities in Canada and the U.S. and the University of Mexico, as a teaching tool.
All play takes place in a simulated 'real-time' environment where stock and news tickers scroll by constantly, and the financial world changes from moment to moment, as you react to news, anticipate economic developments, and research possible investment opportunities, while occasionally, and unexpectedly, being presented with difficult ethical choices at times, where you have to decide whether to gamble on making quick profits or avoid large losses by making unethical choices -- which may sometimes boomerang against you later -- in spades!
Wall Street Raider is a Windows program, for Windows XP, Vista, Win7/8/10 and 11.
This registered version allows games of up to 35 years in length, and you can save games on disk during play (up to 50 games). The registered version also includes a 'Customizer' utility program, to change company names and stock symbols to those of companies in your region or country.
Also included along with the Wall Street Raider program, as HTML files (viewable with Internet Explorer web browser), is the Wall Street Raider Strategy Manual, roughly 300 pages, if printed out, of advice and information on how to use every feature of Raider to achieve maximum advantage. (After our original publisher of WSR read the entire manual, he confided to the author that he felt that he had just earned his MBA, without going to school....)
