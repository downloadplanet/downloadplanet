# Shape Locker
OfficeOne Shape Locker extends PowerPoint to allow you to lock shapes on slides, master slides and layouts. Locked shapes do not allow changes to the attributes that have been locked. The lock information is stored within the presentation file and the shape attributes remain locked even on computers where OfficeOne Shape Locker is not present.
The various attributes that can be locked are:
Position: Do not allow changes to the shape's location.
Size: Do not allow changing the shape's height and width.
Grouping: Do not allow shape to be grouped with other shapes.
Rotation: Do not allow changes in the shape's angle.
Selection: Do not allow the shape to be selected.
Text Editing: Do not allow changes to the text within the shape.
Shape Type: Do not allow changes to shape's type.
Editing Points: Do not allow shape point changes.
Arrowheads: Do not allow changes to line arrowheads.
Adjust Handles: Do not show adjust handles.
Shape Locker works with Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 (32-bit as well as 64-bit) and Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007. Download and install Shape Locker - it will automatically register with your PowerPoint environment. You can access Shape Locker on the Design Tools tab.
