This script allows you to specify certain form elements as "required" or "non-required" and also a specific type they have: text, password, numeric, zip code etc. It works on the native JavaScript, meaning page will be loaded much faster - especially on mobile devices - as no jQuery is needed! The script automatically checks all required elements in order to make sure that they are NOT only empty before allowing the form submission, but also that the surfer entered a valid type value. The output is available in 3 ways: into DIV errors container, with single field error message or with JavaScript Alert() function. The Form Validator is an excellent tool for web developers who: * Write web forms validation procedures * Want to save a lot of time up front * Look for a very powerful tool that helps the creation of web forms * Don't want to write every time validation procedures from the scratch * etc. A Short List of Supported Validations * Required/Non required field * Confirm fields (email/password) * For numbers: signed, unsigned, positive, negative * For strings: upper, lower, normal * Numeric * Integer * Float * Alphabetic * Text * Email * Password * Login * ZipCode * URL * Checkbox checking<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300364647&affiliateid=200057808)
