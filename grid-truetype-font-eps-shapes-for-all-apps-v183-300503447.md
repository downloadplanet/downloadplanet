Grid font set
100 Grid shapes in true type font - set includes true type TTF and EPS format files containing a wide variety of commercial use grid shapes for Indesign, word, pages etc

The grid font shapes set includes the designs in truetype TTF format and eps as well as documentation and a serial and a PDF document showing the relationship between the keyboard and the decorative grid designs

The grid shapes are for commercial and personal use, all are royalty-free - use to create items for sale such as logos, kits, adverts, videos, packaging, cards, wrapping paper and much more. All the grids are by graphicxtras.com (Andrew Buckle).

Load the grid shapes via the keyboard (after selecting the font name in the typeface dropdown of Photoshop etc) and then applying the shapes - you can set the color, re-size the designs (they are vectors for any size of work), combine, blend, export and much more. They can also be used as a source for grid brushes as well as grid pattern and distortions and much more. The grid eps shapes - same as the grid font designs - are all vectors for any size of work also and can be loaded via the file open command of many applications such as Photoshop and others on the PC and MAC OS X

If you have any questions about the grid shapes / font designs, please contact us on support@graphicxtras.com
