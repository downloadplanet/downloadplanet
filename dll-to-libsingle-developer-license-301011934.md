# DLL to Lib(Single developer license)
DLL to Lib is a magical tool which can convert a DLL into its equivalent static library file. After that, you can replace the original DLL with the static library file, rebuild your application, and distribute it without the DLL! The most exciting thing is that the conversion process DOES NOT require any source codes of the DLL files! All works are done from binary to binary. DLL to Lib will rebuild programming interfaces identical to the export functions in the DLL and reconstruct the necessary symbol tables, string tables and reference tables from the DLL to make a valid static library for you!
