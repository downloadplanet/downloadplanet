PACE Suite consists out of three components:
MSI Generator – enables capturing legacy setup of any format into a project, applying corporate packaging standards and generating customized packages of different formats – App-V 5, MSI, MST and ThinApp.
MSI Editor – the tool for extensive editing of Windows Installer packages. Perfect for both advanced packagers and newbies because it greatly combines a simple UI and advanced editing capabilities.
Docu Generator – the handy tool allowing creating screenshot-based instructions like discovery documents.
Every package created with PACE Suite is:
Well-structured and ICE error-free – Correct component and feature assignment, no ICE errors in a repackaged MSI. Table identifiers are human-readable, which makes editing easy.
Contains no tool-related extraneous staff – PACE Suite does not create any redundant MSI tables, properties, or custom actions.
High-quality MSI. PACE Suite follows all application packaging best practices and rules.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300771883&affiliateid=200057808)
