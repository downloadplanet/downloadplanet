# MailPassword
Mail Password is a universal password recovery tool for POP3 email accounts. It recovers all POP3 email logins and passwords stored on your computer by your email software. Mail Password is a universal solution, it supports ALL email programs, including Outlook, Eudora, The Bat! and more. Virtually all e-mail clients use password caching because it's very inconvenient to enter a password every time you get your mail. This means it is possible to discover a stored email password. The universal solution lies in POP3 server emulation. Mail Password uses this method to recover lost email passwords. Mail Password emulates a POP3 server and the E-mail client returns the password. As a result, Mail Password supports ALL email programs. However, there are two limitations: 1) Mail Password does NOT recover passwords to Web-based email accounts, such as Hotmail, Yahoo, usa.net, etc. [Another of our products, Secret Explorer, may help with web-based emails under certain circumstances.] 2) Mail Password is intended to recover YOUR passwords only. It just extracts passwords stored on your computer. It is not a hacker's tool. Mail Password does not allow cracking any other passwords (in most cases it is illegal).
