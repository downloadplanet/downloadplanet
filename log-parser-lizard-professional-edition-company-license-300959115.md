# Log Parser Lizard - Professional Edition - Company License
Your Swiss army knife for system logs and SQL databases. Log Parser Lizard is a powerful GUI for Microsoft Log Parser engine and powerful log analyzer. Analyze your log files and create Excel and PDF reports in seconds. Log Parser is a very powerful, free and versatile tool that provides universal query access to text based data, such as log files, XML files, and CSV files, as well as key data sources on the Microsoft Windows operating system, such as the event log, IIS log, the registry, the file system, and the Active Directory directory service.
