# PropertyEditor Home License
PropertyEditor is a shell extension for Windows Explorer that allows you to customize desktop icons of each folder and drive you choose. PropertyEditor allows you to create detailed reports about the contents of any drive or folder on your PC. This information helps you analyze usage of your hard drives and keeps your data well organized. With PropertyEditor you can see and edit some very useful hidden features of NTFS (file system of Windows NT/2000/XP), such as Streams, Junctions, Hard Links and Mount Points. Windows 2000 introduces the Encrypting File System (EFS) so that users can protect their sensitive data (Windsows XP supports encryption too). PropertyEditor lets you see who has access to encrypted files. Also with PropertyEditor you may modify the date and time that a file or folder was created, last accessed, and last modified, as well PropertyEditor allows you easy to modify attributes of files, folders and drives (including attributes, which you will not be able to change in Explorer).
