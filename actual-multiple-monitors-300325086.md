Actual Multiple Monitors is the comprehensive solution to improve the functionality of Windows® user interface for comfortable and effective work with multi-monitor configurations. The smart app emulates standard Windows® services on secondary monitors, and offers new window management services to free you from routine clicking and let you concentrate on your work undisturbed.
Multi-monitor Taskbar
Powerful yet easy-to-use, the program emulates the original Windows® Taskbar on the secondary displays, allowing you to manage windows in your usual manner. Such Taskbar can work in the individual mode, displaying only the tasks running on the same monitor, or in the mirror mode, displaying all the tasks running on all monitors in your setup. Moreover, you can also choose to emulate the Start button to launch apps more quickly and easily, and Task Switcher to switch between apps without having to redirect your attention to another monitor.
Enhanced Window Management
With Actual Multiple Monitors you won't have to keep reaching for the taskbar each time you want to move any application to another monitor. Now you can put the target window on the monitor of your choice by clicking the additional title bar button or pressing the hotkey (<Win+/> by default). The program also enables you to span the application across all screens by right-clicking the regular Maximize button.
Multi-monitor Background Wallpaper/Screen Saver
You can significantly improve the look-and-feel of your multi-monitor desktop with the Multi-monitor Background Wallpaper and Multi-monitor Screen Saver features. Actual Multiple Monitors lets you either stretch a single background picture over the entire composite desktop or specify individual background pictures on each display (and the same is true for screen savers).
Desktop Profiles, Aero Snap and More
To make your work environment even more comfortable and efficient, Actual Multiple Monitors offers setting up rules for your favorite apps to choose which monitor displays the program at startup. You can also create Desktop Profiles, which include display properties, such as screen resolution, refresh rate, color depth, monitor status (primary or secondary), the type of wallpaper and screensaver (shared or individual for each desktop). And to top it all, the app emulates one of the niftiest features found in Windows 7 - Aero Snap mode.
Try Actual Multiple Monitors right now - and it will make arranging multi-monitor setups a breeze!
