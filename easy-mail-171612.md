# Easy Mail<br />Easy Mail:
Absolutely the easiest way to print envelopes, mailing labels, letters and memos.
Type your message, and then just a few mouse clicks can fax it, print it, prepare an envelope and print a label.
Best of all, leave your printer settings alone! For mailing, just stick an envelope where the paper goes and let Easy Mail handle the rest.
Print only the labels you need right now. Use the rest of the label sheet another time.
Built-in importing uses easy drag-and-drop technology to make it a snap to create Easy Mail Address Files from your existing data files.
