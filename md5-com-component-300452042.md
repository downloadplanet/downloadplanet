# MD5 COM Component
The MD5 Com Component creates an RFC1321 compliant MD5 string from a string of text or file content, The MD5 algorithm takes as input a string of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input string. It is conjectured that it is computationally infeasible to produce two messages having the same message digest, or to produce any message having a given prespecified target message digest. The MD5 algorithm is intended for digital signature applications, where a large file must be "compressed" in a secure manner before being encrypted with a private (secret) key under a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA. In essence, MD5 is a way to verify data integrity, and is much more reliable than checksum and many other commonly used methods.
