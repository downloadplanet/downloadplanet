# MSN Messenger Password<br />MSN Password is a password recovery tool (although not a password cracker) that is used to recover lost or forgotten passwords for your MSN messenger accounts. It is important that the password you are trying to recover is stored on your computer (i.e. you are recovering your own password and not trying to crack someone’s passwords). MSN Password recovers stored login information for the current computer user.
The program is very simple to use, just launch it, make a few mouse clicks and you will get all information about your MSN Messenger account including password. You are not required to be a password recovery professional and make it through a lengthy configuration process – MSN Password works in a fully automatic mode. Even better, you don’t have to wait for hours for the password recovery process to complete. Your MSN passwords will be recovered instantly!
This program is not a hacker tool. It won’t help you to find password of an arbitrary MSN Messenger user. Remember that only your own passwords (stored on your computer) can be recovered.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300069490&affiliateid=200057808)
