CryptoTerm is the package consisting of following programs:
Terminal Emulator,
FTP (SFTP) Client,
Batch FTP (SFTP) Client.
CryptoTerm package allows to obtain a uniform, unified and intuitive access to diversified system environments - starting from Windows, through Unix environments, up to the IBM Mainframe systems. The CryptoTerm provides connections through: Telnet, Serial RS-232, Modem and safe, encrypted SSH(1,2), SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 protocols.
It guarantees unambiguous end-user authentication with the help of: certificates, public/private keys, PKCS#11 devices, NTLM and Kerberos protocols.

CryptoTerm provides accurate terminal emulations: XTERM, ANSI, SCOANSI, VT100, VT220, VT220-8, VT320, VT320-8, WYSE60 (WYSE60 COLOR), LINUX, HP and TN3270 (3278-2, 3278-3, 3278-4, 3278-5, printer 3287-1 and IND$FILE transfer protocol).

The CryptoTerm provides the API functions and implements the COM+ interface to the program in the 3270 emulation, thus offering a possibility to use the emulator mechanisms in the external programs (Word, Excel). Consequently, you may simply grant access to the information stored on the Mainframe class computers to other applications.

The settings of the CryptoTerm terminal emulator (coding characters, connecting method, remote system name, default printer, printing to a file etc.) are stored in the configuration files. This enables to create the pattern files and copy them to the computers of the remaining users.

CryptoTerm is FREE for personal, home use.
