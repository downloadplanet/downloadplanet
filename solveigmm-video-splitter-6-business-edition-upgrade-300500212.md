Here some testimonials of Solveig Multimedia customers:

Thank you for your program. It has a fantastic interface and functionality - head and shoulders above all the others I tried.  I am amazed that full video editors such as ULead don't have the ability to cut sections out of a Video without re-encoding it. I looked for hours before finding yours. It worked just long enough for me to see it had a good interface. Now that I figured out a work-around, I am saving hours editing my WMV's with no loss in quality.

Love the product so far, would like to see frame-accurate editing for WMV's. But this is the best around!
Roland Bowen, USA, Feb 2008

I tried the software and it worked out fine.  It really is doing what it is supposed to do. Namely, to split videos.
I also wish that you let me try the SolveigMM Video Editing SDK.  I wish I could put my hands it it.
Listen, congratulations on your sofware. I was using up until now the video splitter of this company: ... Your software is great. It was well worth the wait.

Thank you for writing the Video Splitter. This is the best program of its type that I have seen! Great navigation operations and fast program response make editing tasks very quick and easy.
John Harris, USA, June 2007

I have been evaluating your video splitter product and would like to purchase for home use, it's a great product - the K-frame / frame navigation controls are pretty good!
Armitage, UK, June 2007

I've tried the SolveigMM VideoSplitter and I must say, for removing ads from WMVs this is by far the best program I've ever used
