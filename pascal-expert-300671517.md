# Pascal Expert<br />Pascal Expert is a development tool that measures, checks, and documents your Delphi or Borland Pascal source code. It makes software projects of any size easier to understand and enables developers to produce more flawless and reliable code. Pascal Expert contains numerous optimization, validation, and documentation features, which help in fine-tuning and managing the development process. In addition, it is an extremely easy tool to use: just select a source file, push a button, and off you go! Pascal Expert quickly pays for itself through easier maintenance, fewer errors, improved code quality, and easier migration of projects between programmers. Reports generated by Pascal Analyzer contain a wealth of important information about the source code. This data will help you better understand your source code, and assist you in producing code of higher quality and reliability. Pascal Analyzer spots many types of programming bugs and anomalies, like unused variables, name conflicts, and incorrect scope. In addition to some common cross-reference reports, PAL for instance produces class hierarchy lists, lists of side effects and warnings about unused identifiers. There are currently more than 50 different types of reports. Alone or combined with each other, these reports will help you retain control over your programs not only during their development but throughout their entire lifetime.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300671517&affiliateid=200057808)
