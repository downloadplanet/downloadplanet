# Miraplacid BinaryDOM / TextDOM SDK<br />Miraplacid Binary and Text DOM SDK represents two complementary technologies - BinaryDOM and TextDOM. This is redistributable software library component (dll) which works on .Net platform accompanied with documentation, data files and examples. Miraplacid Binary Document Object Model (Binary DOM) provides easy access to binary files in known formats. It can be used for binary data analysis and modification. How it works: of course, it cannot be done without knowing the binary file format. Both Miraplacid Binary DOM and Miraplacid Data Viewer rely on Miraplacid Binary Data Definition (.bdd) files, which contain definitions for internal binary file structure. All the .bdd files included into the Miraplacid software package. Miraplacid Text Document Object Model (Text DOM) is similar technology intended for use with text data only. It allows you to create, analyse, modify and validate various text files of known formats. As a model of text schema language, Yacc/Bison language was taken. Unlike BinaryDOM, which preserves all parsed data intact, TextDOM library has a special mode for schema developer which provides a way to forget about unnecessary whitespace characters and comments in the text and concentrate on real text data structures. This is especially helpful in very complex formats like programming languages. It is possible to port existing text definition schemas from EBNF/Yacc/Bison and some other providers formats to TDDL. TextDOM and Miraplacid Text Viewer, a tool based on Miraplacid Text DOM Library, use Miraplacid Text Data Definition (.tdd) files, which could be found on the same community web site http://BinoPedia.org. Free for individual use and qualified educational institutions.<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300858132&affiliateid=200057808)
