It can be lost at any time due to hard drive crash, virus attack and many other unexpected factors. With SmartSync Pro your critical data will be always safe! SmartSync Pro is a universal full-featured tool to back up and synchronize your important data to the local drive, external Flash/USB/ZIP drive, CD/DVD, NAS and other storage devices, network volumes or even remote computer. If your data has been corrupted or lost, you will easily recover it from a backup copy. The program comes with an intuitive step-by-step wizard that helps setting up backup profiles to configure what, where and when to copy. The wizard offers default options such as backing up My Documents folder or MS Outlook / Outlook Express files.

As a unique feature, SmartSync Pro allows synchronizing files and folders when computers cannot be connected over a local network (e.g. home/office PCs). The program compresses data to a package that is transferred to the remote computer using removable drive, e-mail or FTP. SmartSync Pro can be run as a service under NT/2000/XP/2003 to perform scheduled tasks even when nobody is logged in. The multilanguage user interface is available in 10 languages.
