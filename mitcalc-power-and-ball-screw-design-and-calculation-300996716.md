# MITCalc Power and Ball screw design and calculation<br />Power screw
This program (algorithm) is used to design and check power screws. It is used to solve the following tasks:
- Calculation of kinematic parameters (speed, torque, revolutions and power output...
- Simple selection / definition of power screw (metric, square, trapezoidal...)
- Screw check for tensile/pressure, thrust, bend, buckling and critical revolutions.
- The program contains a table of materials, threads and friction coefficients.
- Support of 2D CAD systems.
The calculation is based on data, procedures and algorithms from specialized literature and AGMA, ISO, DIN and BS standards.
List of standards: (ISO 68-1, 68-2, ISO 724, ISO 965, ISO 2904: 1977, DIN 513, CSN 01 4050, CSN 01 4052, ANSI/ACME B1.5-1977, ANSI/ACME B1.9-1973, ASME B1.1-2003, IS 4694-1968....)

Ball screws.
This program (algorithm) is used to design, calculate and check ball screws. It is used to solve the following tasks:
- Preliminary design (minimum input parameters â€“ sufficient to navigate and select from catalogs)
- Detailed analysis (load, dimensions, parameter check)
- Load spectrum table definition (speed, torque, revolutions and power output...)
- Calculation of an equivalent load
- Service life calculation, tolerances, temperature analysis
- Tensile/Pressure, thrust, bend, buckling and critical revolutions
- Lubrication proposal and efficiency calculation
- The program contains tables of screws according to ISO and ANSI
- Support of 2D CAD systems
The calculation is based on data, procedures and algorithms from specialized literature and AGMA, ISO, DIN and BS standards.
List of standards: ISO 3408-1:2006; ISO 3408-2: 1991; ISO 3408-3:2006; ISO 3408-4:2006; ISO 3408-5:2006; ISO 286-2:2010; DIN ISO 3408; JIS B1192-1997; JIS B1192-2018; DIN 69051-5; ANSI B5.48<br />[>> Detailed information](https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/product.html?productid=300996716&affiliateid=200057808)
