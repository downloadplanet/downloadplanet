The MainConcept XDCAM Decoder Pack is a comprehensive set of video and audio decoders that enable playback of Sony XDCAM content including XDCAM EX, XDCAM HD, XDCAM IMX or DVCAM. After successful installation, the decoder pack automatically plugs in to applications that are based on Sony’s XDCAM SDK, unlocking full decoding functionality that was previously limited in the decoder’s default demo mode.

The Sony XDCAM SDK allows development partners to create third party applications that can be used for managing, archiving, and playing back content delivered by the latest Sony XDCAM camcorders and decks. The pre-installed decoders from MainConcept are available to users as a demo version (resulting in logo watermarked video playback and audio playback limitations). Purchasing the XDCAM SDK Decoder Pack provides users with full access to the XDCAM video and audio decoders unlocking support for the entire XDCAM codec family.

The MainConcept XDCAM Decoder Pack can only be used when an application is installed that is based on and developed using the Sony XDCAM SDK (not included).
