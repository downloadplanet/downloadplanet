# Serien-Mails
Send personalized newsletters and serial emails. Import the list of address from a DBF data base or a txt or csv file. Then you can design the mails in the program. The program offers you a typical newsletter design as template. But you can also import HTML or RTF files. Later you can change the HTML source code if you want. Of course you can also create normal text mails. You can personalize the mails, that means you can add the name of the recepients etc. For fast sending of non personalized mails the program offers the sending as Blind Carbon Copy. So you need to send only one mail for 50 recepients.
