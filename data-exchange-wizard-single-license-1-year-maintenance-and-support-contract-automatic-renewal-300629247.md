Data Exchange Wizard loads data into ANY database from Text, Excel, MS Access, DBF files or any ODBC compliant database. Alternatively, data from Oracle, MS SQL Server or any ODBC source can be exported into flat files. It is easy to use and  and does not require advanced technical knowledge or skills.
Data Exchange Wizard may run calculations during import and may also execute SQL statements before and after import. The unique ability to add new and update old records based on the primary key distinguishes Data Exchange Wizard from many other competitors, such as Oracle SQL loader, BCP, DTS or SSIS. The other benefits of the product include a built-in expression builder, error log, and rejected records file.
Many businesses need to centralize data to improve corporate decision-making. But their data may be stored in a variety of formats and in different locations. Data Exchange Wizard addresses this critical business need by providing tools that let you load and consolidate data from disparate sources into single destination. The product is a definite benefit for any organization that needs to create custom data movement solution tailored to the specific business need of your organization.
