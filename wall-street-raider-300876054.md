# Wall Street Raider<br />Ronin Software is pleased to announce the latest release of our software game program, "Wall Street Raider," for Windows XP, Vista or Win 7/8/10/11 systems.
Wall Street Raider, now played by registered users in over 110 countries and all 50 U.S. states, is a highly realistic simulation of the stock market and global economy, in which each player begins with up to $1 billion and competes against up to four other human or computer players in buying, selling and shorting stocks, trading government bonds, corporate bonds (including convertible bonds), put and call options, and commodity and stock index futures, and entering into interest rate swap derivatives contracts (which are basically bets on the direction of various interest rates) with brokers or financial institutions as the counter-party. The simulation allows for up to five players (4 of which can be computer bots) and consists of up to 1,575 corporations in 70 industry groups, plus 15 Exchange-Traded Funds ("ETFs") that invest in stocks and in other investments such as options or commodities.
Players can also buy up control of one or more companies and manage them, attempting to increase each company's stock price by various means, including a full range of realistic corporate financial transactions, such as mergers, liquidations, spin-offs, LBOs, greenmail, stock and bond offerings, etc.
The object of the game is to parlay your already large initial $1 billion stake into a massive corporate empire, increasing your net worth to more than that of any of the other players, whether they are human players or computer players. Human and computer players will often battle for control of key companies and bank lenders, using tactics such as cutting off the lines of credit to competing players or companies when you control their lending bank.
All action in this fun and educational game occurs in a simulated "live" economy and stock market. Play is punctuated at times by financial booms or shocks, technology or marketing breakthroughs (or breakdowns) at individual companies, and major political or economic events, with constantly scrolling stock and news headline tickers providing a massive flow of investment information. At any time, as a company CEO, you may also be confronted with hard ethical choices that suddenly pop up, where it may be more profitable to make the unethical choice -- but with possible severe blowback months or years of game play later if your "cutting corners" turns out not to be such a good idea, after all....
The investment and economic environment of the simulation constantly changes as players do their investment research and trading, using the wide range of research tools provided, while seeking out profitable investments in the turbulent and very realistic financial financial markets and economic model created by the simulation.
NOTE TO EDUCATORS: Because of its realistic modeling of the real Wall Street and world financial environment, and ease of playing, the Wall Street Raider game and simulation is used as an educational tool in university finance classes, business schools, and law schools in Canada, Mexico and the U.S. Site licenses for 200 copies of the full package version, good for five years, are available for $250.

Health warning: Caution -- Wall Street Raider is highly addictive, known to cause all-night binges with resulting loss of sleep and reduced productivity due to playing it while at work.
