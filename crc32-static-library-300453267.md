# CRC32 Static Library
CRC32 Static Library for Microsoft VC++ was produced to make your CRC checking operations quick & easy to implement seamlessly without the need for an external DLL The algorithm of CRC32 is exactly the same as that internally used by PKZIP and WinZip; i.e. the CRCs calculated by PKZIP and CRC32 are identical. That’s another fine thing about CRC32 - it calculates compatible, widely used 32-bit checksums, not just any numbers. You can use the 'pkunzip.exe -vt filename.zip' command to see that PKZIP’s CRC-32 values of files stored inside the filename.zip are identical to that calculated by CRC32 for these files.
NOTE: 1 single license is required per installation
All Updates to 1.xx are free of charge.
